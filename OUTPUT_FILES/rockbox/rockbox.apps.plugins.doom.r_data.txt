       * cph - I find it hard to believe that sparc memcpy is broken,
       * but I don't believe the pointers to memcpy have to be aligned
       * either. Use fast memcpy on other machines anyway.
       
        proff - I took this out, because Oli Kraus (olikraus@yahoo.com) told
        me the memcpy produced a buserror. Since this function isn't time-
        critical I'm using the for loop now.

R_TextureNumForName Calls R_CheckTextureNumForName,  aborts with error message. const added -- killough R_PrecacheLevel Preloads all relevant graphics for the level. Totally rewritten by Lee Killough to use less memory, to avoid using alloca(), and to improve performance. cph - new wad lump handling, calls cache functions but acquires no locks Structures from p_spec.c Used to fully cache animations in the level -> avoids stalls on Hard Drive Systems Precache flats. If flat is an animation, load those too Definately not the most efficient, but better then stalls in game Precache textures. If texture is an animation, load those too Definately not the most efficient, but better then stalls in game Sky texture is always present. Note that F_SKY1 is the name used to  indicate a sky floor/ceiling as a flat,  while the sky texture is stored like  a wall texture, with an episode dependend  name. Precache sprites.
