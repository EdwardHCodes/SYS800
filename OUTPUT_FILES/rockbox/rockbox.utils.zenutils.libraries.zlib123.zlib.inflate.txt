  function prototypes  to support ill-conceived Java test suite  in case we return an error 
   Return state with length and distance decoding tables and index sizes set to
   fixed code decoding.  Normally this returns fixed tables from inffixed.h.
   If BUILDFIXED is defined, then instead this routine builds the tables the
   first time it's called, and returns those tables the first time and
   thereafter.  This reduces the size of the code by about 2K bytes, in
   exchange for a little execution time.  However, BUILDFIXED should not be
   used for threaded applications, since the rewriting of the tables and virgin
   may not be thread-safe.
  build fixed huffman tables if first call (may not be thread safe)  literal/length table  distance table  do this just once  !BUILDFIXED  BUILDFIXED 
   Write out the inffixed.h that is #include'd above.  Defining MAKEFIXED also
   defines BUILDFIXED, so the tables are built on the fly.  makefixed() writes
   those tables to stdout, which would be piped to inffixed.h.  A small program
   can simply call makefixed to do this:

    void makefixed(void);

    int main(void)
    {
        makefixed();
        return 0;
    }

   Then that can be linked with zlib built with MAKEFIXED defined and run:

    a.out > inffixed.h
  MAKEFIXED 
   Update the window with the last wsize (normally 32K) bytes written before
   returning.  If window does not exist yet, create it.  This is only called
   when a window is already in use, or when output has been written during this
   inflate call, but the end of the deflate stream has not been reached yet.
   It is also called to create a window for dictionary data when a dictionary
   is loaded.

   Providing output buffers larger than 32K to inflate() should provide a speed
   advantage, since only the last 32K of output is copied to the sliding window
   upon return from inflate(), and since all distances after the first 32K of
   output will fall in the output data, making match copies simpler and faster.
   The advantage may be dependent on the size of the processor's data caches.
  if it hasn't been done already, allocate space for the window  if window not in use yet, initialize  copy state->wsize or less output bytes into the circular window  Macros for inflate():  check function to use adler32() for zlib or crc32() for gzip  check macros for header crc  Load registers with state in inflate() for speed  Restore state from registers in inflate()  Clear the input bit accumulator  Get a byte of input into the bit accumulator, or return from inflate()
   if there is no input available.  Assure that there are at least n bits in the bit accumulator.  If there is
   not enough available input to do that, then return from inflate().  Return the low n bits of the bit accumulator (n < 16)  Remove n bits from the bit accumulator  Remove zero to seven bits as needed to go to a byte boundary  Reverse the bytes in a 32-bit value 
   inflate() uses a state machine to process as much input data and generate as
   much output data as possible before returning.  The state machine is
   structured roughly as follows:

    for (;;) switch (state) {
    ...
    case STATEn:
        if (not enough input data or output space to make progress)
            return;
        ... make progress ...
        state = STATEm;
        break;
    ...
    }

   so when inflate() is called again, the same case is attempted again, and
   if the appropriate resources are provided, the machine proceeds to the
   next state.  The NEEDBITS() macro is usually the way the state evaluates
   whether it can proceed or should return.  NEEDBITS() does the return if
   the requested bits are not available.  The typical use of the BITS macros
   is:

        NEEDBITS(n);
        ... do something with BITS(n) ...
        DROPBITS(n);

   where NEEDBITS(n) either returns from inflate() if there isn't enough
   input left to load n bits into the accumulator, or it continues.  BITS(n)
   gives the low n bits in the accumulator.  When done, DROPBITS(n) drops
   the low n bits off the accumulator.  INITBITS() clears the accumulator
   and sets the number of available bits to zero.  BYTEBITS() discards just
   enough bits to put the accumulator on a byte boundary.  After BYTEBITS()
   and a NEEDBITS(8), then BITS(8) would return the next byte in the stream.

   NEEDBITS(n) uses PULLBYTE() to get an available byte of input, or to return
   if there is no input available.  The decoding of variable length codes uses
   PULLBYTE() directly in order to pull just enough bytes to decode the next
   code, and no more.

   Some states loop until they get enough input, making sure that enough
   state information is maintained to continue the loop where it left off
   if NEEDBITS() returns in the loop.  For example, want, need, and keep
   would all have to actually be part of the saved state in case NEEDBITS()
   returns:

    case STATEw:
        while (want < need) {
            NEEDBITS(n);
            keep[want++] = BITS(n);
            DROPBITS(n);
        }
        state = STATEx;
    case STATEx:

   As shown above, if the next state is also the next case, then the break
   is omitted.

   A state may also return if there is not enough output space available to
   complete that state.  Those states are copying stored data, writing a
   literal byte, and copying a matching string.

   When returning, a "goto inf_leave" is used to update the total counters,
   update the check value, and determine whether any progress has been made
   during that inflate() call in order to return the proper return code.
   Progress is defined as a change in either strm->avail_in or strm->avail_out.
   When there is a window, goto inf_leave will update the window with the last
   output written.  If a goto inf_leave occurs in the middle of decompression
   and there is no window currently, goto inf_leave will create one and copy
   output to the window for the next call of inflate().

   In this implementation, the flush parameter of inflate() only affects the
   return code (per zlib.h).  inflate() always writes as much as possible to
   strm->next_out, given the space available and the provided input--the effect
   documented in zlib.h of Z_SYNC_FLUSH.  Furthermore, inflate() always defers
   the allocation of and copying into a sliding window until necessary, which
   provides the effect documented in zlib.h for Z_FINISH when the entire input
   stream available.  So the only thing the flush parameter actually does is:
   when flush is set to Z_FINISH, inflate() cannot return Z_OK.  Instead it
   will return Z_BUF_ERROR if it has not reached the end of the stream.

       Return from inflate(), updating the total counts and the check value.
       If there was no progress during the inflate() call, return a buffer

   found in order so far, in 0..3.  On return *have is updated to the new
   state.  If on return *have equals four, then the pattern was found and the
   return value is how many bytes were read including the last byte of the
   pattern.  If *have is less than four, then the pattern has not been found
   yet and the return value is len.  In the latter case, syncsearch() can be
   called again with more data and the *have state.  *have is initialized to
   zero for the first call.

   Returns true if inflate is currently at the end of a block generated by
   Z_SYNC_FLUSH or Z_FULL_FLUSH. This function is used by one PPP
   implementation to provide an additional safety check. PPP uses
   Z_SYNC_FLUSH but removes the length bytes of the resulting empty stored
   block. When decompressing, PPP checks that at the end of input packet,
   inflate is waiting for these length bytes.

  function prototypes  to support ill-conceived Java test suite  in case we return an error 
   Return state with length and distance decoding tables and index sizes set to
   fixed code decoding.  Normally this returns fixed tables from inffixed.h.
   If BUILDFIXED is defined, then instead this routine builds the tables the
   first time it's called, and returns those tables the first time and
   thereafter.  This reduces the size of the code by about 2K bytes, in
   exchange for a little execution time.  However, BUILDFIXED should not be
   used for threaded applications, since the rewriting of the tables and virgin
   may not be thread-safe.
  build fixed huffman tables if first call (may not be thread safe)  literal/length table  distance table  do this just once  !BUILDFIXED  BUILDFIXED 
   Write out the inffixed.h that is #include'd above.  Defining MAKEFIXED also
   defines BUILDFIXED, so the tables are built on the fly.  makefixed() writes
   those tables to stdout, which would be piped to inffixed.h.  A small program
   can simply call makefixed to do this:

    void makefixed(void);

    int main(void)
    {
        makefixed();
        return 0;
    }

   Then that can be linked with zlib built with MAKEFIXED defined and run:

    a.out > inffixed.h
  MAKEFIXED 
   Update the window with the last wsize (normally 32K) bytes written before
   returning.  If window does not exist yet, create it.  This is only called
   when a window is already in use, or when output has been written during this
   inflate call, but the end of the deflate stream has not been reached yet.
   It is also called to create a window for dictionary data when a dictionary
   is loaded.

   Providing output buffers larger than 32K to inflate() should provide a speed
   advantage, since only the last 32K of output is copied to the sliding window
   upon return from inflate(), and since all distances after the first 32K of
   output will fall in the output data, making match copies simpler and faster.
   The advantage may be dependent on the size of the processor's data caches.
  if it hasn't been done already, allocate space for the window  if window not in use yet, initialize  copy state->wsize or less output bytes into the circular window  Macros for inflate():  check function to use adler32() for zlib or crc32() for gzip  check macros for header crc  Load registers with state in inflate() for speed  Restore state from registers in inflate()  Clear the input bit accumulator  Get a byte of input into the bit accumulator, or return from inflate()
   if there is no input available.  Assure that there are at least n bits in the bit accumulator.  If there is
   not enough available input to do that, then return from inflate().  Return the low n bits of the bit accumulator (n < 16)  Remove n bits from the bit accumulator  Remove zero to seven bits as needed to go to a byte boundary  Reverse the bytes in a 32-bit value 
   inflate() uses a state machine to process as much input data and generate as
   much output data as possible before returning.  The state machine is
   structured roughly as follows:

    for (;;) switch (state) {
    ...
    case STATEn:
        if (not enough input data or output space to make progress)
            return;
        ... make progress ...
        state = STATEm;
        break;
    ...
    }

   so when inflate() is called again, the same case is attempted again, and
   if the appropriate resources are provided, the machine proceeds to the
   next state.  The NEEDBITS() macro is usually the way the state evaluates
   whether it can proceed or should return.  NEEDBITS() does the return if
   the requested bits are not available.  The typical use of the BITS macros
   is:

        NEEDBITS(n);
        ... do something with BITS(n) ...
        DROPBITS(n);

   where NEEDBITS(n) either returns from inflate() if there isn't enough
   input left to load n bits into the accumulator, or it continues.  BITS(n)
   gives the low n bits in the accumulator.  When done, DROPBITS(n) drops
   the low n bits off the accumulator.  INITBITS() clears the accumulator
   and sets the number of available bits to zero.  BYTEBITS() discards just
   enough bits to put the accumulator on a byte boundary.  After BYTEBITS()
   and a NEEDBITS(8), then BITS(8) would return the next byte in the stream.

   NEEDBITS(n) uses PULLBYTE() to get an available byte of input, or to return
   if there is no input available.  The decoding of variable length codes uses
   PULLBYTE() directly in order to pull just enough bytes to decode the next
   code, and no more.

   Some states loop until they get enough input, making sure that enough
   state information is maintained to continue the loop where it left off
   if NEEDBITS() returns in the loop.  For example, want, need, and keep
   would all have to actually be part of the saved state in case NEEDBITS()
   returns:

    case STATEw:
        while (want < need) {
            NEEDBITS(n);
            keep[want++] = BITS(n);
            DROPBITS(n);
        }
        state = STATEx;
    case STATEx:

   As shown above, if the next state is also the next case, then the break
   is omitted.

   A state may also return if there is not enough output space available to
   complete that state.  Those states are copying stored data, writing a
   literal byte, and copying a matching string.

   When returning, a "goto inf_leave" is used to update the total counters,
   update the check value, and determine whether any progress has been made
   during that inflate() call in order to return the proper return code.
   Progress is defined as a change in either strm->avail_in or strm->avail_out.
   When there is a window, goto inf_leave will update the window with the last
   output written.  If a goto inf_leave occurs in the middle of decompression
   and there is no window currently, goto inf_leave will create one and copy
   output to the window for the next call of inflate().

   In this implementation, the flush parameter of inflate() only affects the
   return code (per zlib.h).  inflate() always writes as much as possible to
   strm->next_out, given the space available and the provided input--the effect
   documented in zlib.h of Z_SYNC_FLUSH.  Furthermore, inflate() always defers
   the allocation of and copying into a sliding window until necessary, which
   provides the effect documented in zlib.h for Z_FINISH when the entire input
   stream available.  So the only thing the flush parameter actually does is:
   when flush is set to Z_FINISH, inflate() cannot return Z_OK.  Instead it
   will return Z_BUF_ERROR if it has not reached the end of the stream.

   or when out of input.  When called, *have is the number of pattern bytes
   found in order so far, in 0..3.  On return *have is updated to the new
   state.  If on return *have equals four, then the pattern was found and the
   return value is how many bytes were read including the last byte of the
   pattern.  If *have is less than four, then the pattern has not been found
   yet and the return value is len.  In the latter case, syncsearch() can be
   called again with more data and the *have state.  *have is initialized to
   zero for the first call.

   Returns true if inflate is currently at the end of a block generated by
   Z_SYNC_FLUSH or Z_FULL_FLUSH. This function is used by one PPP
   implementation to provide an additional safety check. PPP uses
   Z_SYNC_FLUSH but removes the length bytes of the resulting empty stored
   block. When decompressing, PPP checks that at the end of input packet,
   inflate is waiting for these length bytes.
