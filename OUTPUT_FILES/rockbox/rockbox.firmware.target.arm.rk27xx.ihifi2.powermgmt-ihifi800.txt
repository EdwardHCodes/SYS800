 ***************************************************************************  Battery voltage calculation and discharge/charge curves for the iHiFi 800

    Battery voltage is calculated under the assumption that the adc full-scale
    readout represents 3.00V and that the battery ADC channel is fed with
    exactly half of the battery voltage (through a resistive divider).
    Charge curve have not been calibrated yet.
 5%  0%  voltages (millivolt) of 0%, 10%, ... 100% when charging disabled  voltages (millivolt) of 0%, 10%, ... 100% when charging enabled  full-scale ADC readout (2^10) in millivolt  Returns battery voltage from ADC [millivolts] **************************************************************************
