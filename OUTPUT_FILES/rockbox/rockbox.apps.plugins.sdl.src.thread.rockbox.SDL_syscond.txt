 An implementation of condition variables using semaphores and mutexes 
   This implementation borrows heavily from the BeOS condition variable
   implementation, written by Christopher Tate and Owen Smith.  Thanks!
  Create a condition variable  Destroy a condition variable  Restart one of the threads that are waiting on the condition variable  If there are waiting threads not already signalled, then
	   signal the condition and wait for the thread to respond.
	 Restart all threads that are waiting on the condition variable  If there are waiting threads not already signalled, then
	   signal the condition and wait for the thread to respond.
	 Now all released threads are blocked here, waiting for us.
		   Collect them all (and win fabulous prizes!) :-)
		  Wait on the condition variable for at most 'ms' milliseconds.
   The mutex must be locked before entering this function!
   The mutex is unlocked during the wait, and locked again after the wait.

Typical use:

Thread A:
	SDL_LockMutex(lock);
	while ( ! condition ) {
		SDL_CondWait(cond);
	}
	SDL_UnlockMutex(lock);

Thread B:
	SDL_LockMutex(lock);
	...
	condition = true;
	...
	SDL_UnlockMutex(lock);
  Obtain the protection mutex, and increment the number of waiters.
	   This allows the signal mechanism to only perform a signal if there
	   are waiting threads.
	  Unlock the mutex, as is required by condition variable semantics  Wait for a signal  Let the signaler know we have completed the wait, otherwise
           the signaler can race ahead and get the condition semaphore
           if we are stopped between the mutex unlock and semaphore wait,
           giving a deadlock.  See the following URL for details:
        http://www-classic.be.com/aboutbe/benewsletter/volume_III/Issue40.html
	 If we timed out, we need to eat a condition signal  We always notify the signal thread that we are done  Signal handshake complete  Lock the mutex, as is required by condition variable semantics  Wait on the condition variable forever
