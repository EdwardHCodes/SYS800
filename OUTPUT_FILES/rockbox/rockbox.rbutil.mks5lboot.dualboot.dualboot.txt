 *************************************************************************** How it works:
 *
 * - dualboot-installer: installs or updates a RB bootloader, the bootloader
 *   to install/update is already included into dualboot-installer.dfu file,
 *   once it is executed by the iPod device:
 *
 *   1) locates an original NORBOOT (ONB): first it looks at offset=32KB, if
 *      a NORBOOT is found but it is not an ONB then it is supposed it is a
 *      RB bootloader (that should be updated), then the ONB is loaded from
 *      offset=32KB+old_BLSIZE).
 *   2) write ONB at 32KB+new_BLSIZE, if it fails then:
 *      2a) try to restore ONB to its 'pristine' place (offset=32KB), if it
 *          also fails then the NOR got corrupted (ONB probably destroyed)
 *          and iTunes should be used to restore the iPod.
 *   3) write new (included) RB bootloader at offset=32KB, it it fails then
 *      goto 2a)
 *
 * - dualboot-uninstaller: uninstall RB bootloader from NOR, leaving it at
 *   it's previous (pristine) state.
 *
 * See bootloader/ipod6g.c for notes on how the RB bootloader works.
