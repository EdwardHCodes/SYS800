 *************************************************************************** A simple parser to read vital metadata from a FLAC file - length,
     * frequency, bitrate etc. This code should either be moved to a
     * seperate file, or discarded in favour of the libFLAC code.
     * The FLAC stream specification can be found at
     * http://flac.sourceforge.net/format.html#stream
      Use the trackname part of the id3 structure as a temporary buffer  The length of the block  0 is the STREAMINFO block  All FLAC files are VBR  Got vital metadata  totalsamples is a 36-bit field, but we assume <= 32 bits are used  Calculate track length (in ms) and estimate the bitrate (in kbit/s)  4 is the VORBIS_COMMENT block  The next i bytes of the file contain the VORBIS COMMENTS.  6 is the PICTURE block  only use the first PICTURE  skip picture type  16 = skip picture width,height,color-depth,color-used  if we support the format and image length is in the buffer  Skip to next metadata block **************************************************************************
