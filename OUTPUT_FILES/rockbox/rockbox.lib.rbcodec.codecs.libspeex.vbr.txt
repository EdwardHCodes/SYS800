  This function should analyse the signal and decide how critical the
  coding error will be perceptually. The following factors should be
  taken into account:

  -Attacks (positive energy derivative) should be coded with more bits

  -Stationary voiced segments should receive more bits

  -Segments with (very) low absolute energy should receive less bits (maybe
  only shaped noise?)

  -DTX for near-zero energy?

  -Stationary fricative segments should have less bits

  -Temporal masking: when energy slope is decreasing, decrease the bit-rate

  -Decrease bit-rate for males (low pitch)?

  -(wideband only) less bits in the high-band when signal is very 
  non-stationary (harder to notice high-frequency noise)???
