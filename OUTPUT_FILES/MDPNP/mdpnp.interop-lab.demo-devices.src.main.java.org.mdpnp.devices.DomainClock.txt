 Resolution of SampleArray samples will be reduced dynamically based upon what SampleArrays are registered at what frequency. It's important to multiply first because hertz may not divide 1000000000ns evenly max res (min sample period) is an even number of seconds max res (min sample period) is an even number of seconds Resolution of SampleArray samples will be reduced dynamically based upon what SampleArrays are registered at what frequency.
