 *
 *  The behaviour of this driver can be altered by setting some parameters
 *  from the insmod command line.
 *
 *  The following parameters are adjustable:
 *
 *	bus0	These four arguments must be arrays of
 *	bus1	3 unsigned integers as follows:
 *	bus2
 *	bus3	<id>,<pin>,<od>
 *
 *  where:
 *
 *  <id>	ID to used as device_id for the corresponding bus (required)
 *  <sda>	GPIO pin ID of data pin (required)
 *  <od>	Pin is configured as open drain.
 *
 *  See include/w1-gpio.h for more information about the parameters.
 *
 *  If this driver is built into the kernel, you can use the following kernel
 *  command line parameters, with the same values as the corresponding module
 *  parameters listed above:
 *
 *	w1-gpio-custom.bus0
 *	w1-gpio-custom.bus1
 *	w1-gpio-custom.bus2
 *	w1-gpio-custom.bus3
