 d_init.c: rasterization driver initialization
===============
D_Init
===============

===============
D_CopyRects
===============
 this function is only required if the CPU doesn't have direct access to the back buffer, and there's some driver interface function that the driver doesn't support and requires Quake to do in software (such as drawing the console); Quake will then draw into wherever the driver points vid.buffer and will call this function before swapping buffers
===============
D_EnableBackBufferAccess
===============

===============
D_TurnZOn
===============
 not needed for software version
===============
D_DisableBackBufferAccess
===============

===============
D_SetupFrame
===============

===============
D_UpdateRects
===============
 the software driver draws these directly to the vid buffer
