 This is the system specific header for the SDL joystick API  Function to scan the system for joysticks.
 * This function should set SDL_numjoysticks to the number of available
 * joysticks.  Joystick 0 should be the system default joystick.
 * It should return 0, or -1 on an unrecoverable fatal error.
  Function to get the device-dependent name of a joystick  Function to open a joystick for use.
   The joystick to open is specified by the index field of the joystick.
   This should fill the nbuttons and naxes fields of the joystick structure.
   It returns 0, or -1 if there is an error.
  Function to update the state of a joystick - called as a device poll.
 * This function shouldn't update the joystick structure directly,
 * but instead should call SDL_PrivateJoystick*() to deliver events
 * and update joystick device state.
  Function to close a joystick after use  Function to perform any system-specific joystick related cleanup  SDL_JOYSTICK_DUMMY || SDL_JOYSTICK_DISABLED
