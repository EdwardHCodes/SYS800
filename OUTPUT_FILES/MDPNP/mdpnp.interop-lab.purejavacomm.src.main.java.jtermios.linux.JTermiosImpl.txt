 public char io_type;public char reserved_char;public char io_type;public char reserved_char;linux/serial.h stuff Looked up manuallyfcntl.h stufferrno.h stufftermios.h stuffpoll.h stuff If duration is not zero, it sends zero-valued bits for duration*N seconds, where N is at least 0.25, and not more than 0.5. This ioctl is Linux specific, so keep it private for now Do the logging here as this does not go through the JTermios which normally does the logging First we have to determine which serial drivers exist and which prefixes they use /proc/tty/drivers contains the prefix in the second column and "serial" in the fifth Sanity check the prefix Now build the pattern from the known prefixes found the baudrate from the table just in case custom divisor was in use, try to turn it off first now set the speed with the constant from the table baudrate not defined in the table, try custom divisor approach configure port to use custom speed instead of 38400
