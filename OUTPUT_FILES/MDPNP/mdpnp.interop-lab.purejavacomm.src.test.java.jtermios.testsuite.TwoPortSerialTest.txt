 * Executes tests to check the correct implementation of frame format settings.
 * You'll need two serial ports connected by a null-modem cable to execute them.

 * Start this application for the receiving port first and then the sender.

 * <strong>Beware that you'll need capable hardware and drivers to check all
 * settings, especially mark/space parity and &lt; 7 data bits. The bleeding
 * edge Linux or Win32 drivers for PL2303 are good candidates.</strong>

 * To ensure that your driver/device isn't lying about its support of a specific
 * setting, you should run your tests with different models of serial ports for
 * sender and receiver.
