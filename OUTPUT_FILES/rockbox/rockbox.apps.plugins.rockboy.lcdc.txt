 * stat_trigger updates the STAT interrupt line to reflect whether any
 * of the conditions set to be tested (by bits 3-6 of R_STAT) are met.
 * This function should be called whenever any of the following occur:
 * 1) LY or LYC changes.
 * 2) A state transition affects the low 2 bits of R_STAT (see below).
 * 3) The program writes to the upper bits of R_STAT.
 * stat_trigger also updates bit 2 of R_STAT to reflect whether LY=LYC.
 
 * stat_change is called when a transition results in a change to the
 * LCD STAT condition (the low 2 bits of R_STAT).  It raises or lowers
 * the VBLANK interrupt line appropriately and calls stat_trigger to
 * update the STAT interrupt line.
