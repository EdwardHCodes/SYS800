   This viewer plugin is for the encryption/decryption of iPod Nano
   (2nd generation) firmware images using the hardware AES crypto unit
   in such devices.

   Encrypted images are stored with the modelname "nn2x" and extension
   ".ipodx" Unencrypted images use "nn2g" and ".ipod".

   Heavily based on Payloads/CryptFirmware/main.c from iBugger.
