     *  Moreover this helps to avoid flickering when
     *  being in some screens like USB mode and
     *  pressing some keys / touchpad...
      Check for limits and adjust in case  Set pin low for a sufficient time, puts the device into low-power consumption state
         * In other words backlight goes off
          This enables 16 levels of backlight  Set the value according Table 1 in datasheet
             * For MAX_CURRENT_15, the scale is from 0 mA to 15 mA in 16 steps
              This enables other 4 levels of backlight  Set the value according Table 1 in datasheet
             * For LOW_CURRENT, there is no "real" scale. We have scattered values.
             * We are interested in the last 3 -> 0.5 mA; 1 mA; 2 mA
              power on lcd + visible display  restore the previous backlight level  there is no real on/off but we can set to 0 brightness  power off visible display **************************************************************************
