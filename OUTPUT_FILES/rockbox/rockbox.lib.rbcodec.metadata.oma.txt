 * This is a demuxer for Sony OpenMG Music files
 *
 * Known file extensions: ".oma", "aa3"
 * The format of such files consists of three parts:
 * - "ea3" header carrying overall info and metadata.
 * - "EA3" header is a Sony-specific header containing information about
 *   the OpenMG file: codec type (usually ATRAC, can also be MP3 or WMA),
 *   codec specific info (packet size, sample rate, channels and so on)
 *   and DRM related info (file encryption, content id).
 * - Sound data organized in packets follow the EA3 header
 *   (can be encrypted using the Sony DRM!).
 *
 * LIMITATIONS: This version supports only plain (unencrypted) OMA files.
 * If any DRM-protected (encrypted) file is encountered you will get the
 * corresponding error message. Try to remove the encryption using any
 * Sony software (for example SonicStage).
 * CODEC SUPPORT: Only ATRAC3 codec is currently supported!
  Various helper macros taken from ffmpeg for reading *
 * and writing buffers with a specified endianess.      Different codecs that could be present in a Sony OMA *
 * container file.                                       FIXME: This functions currently read different file *
 *        parameters required for decoding. It still   *
 *        does not read the metadata - which should be *
 *        present in the ea3 (first) header. The       *
 *        metadata in ea3 is stored as a variation of  *
 *        the ID3v2 metadata format.                    get stereo coding mode, 1 for joint-stereo  fake the atrac3 extradata (wav format, makes stream copy to wav work)  ATRAC3 expects and extra-data size of 14 bytes for wav format, and *
             * looks for that in the id3v2buf.                                     always 1 samples rate coding mode coding mode always 1 always 0 Store the the offset of the first audio frame, to be able to seek to it *
     * directly in atrac3_oma.codec.                                            Currently, there's no means of knowing the duration *
     * directly from the the file so we calculate it.
