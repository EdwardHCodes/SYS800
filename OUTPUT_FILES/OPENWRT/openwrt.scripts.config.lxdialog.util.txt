  Needed in signal handler in mconf.c 
 * Select color theme
 
 * Setup for color display
 
 * Set window to attribute 'attr'
  Display background title if it exists ... - SLH  3 is for the arrow and spaces 
 * Do some initialization for dialog
  Init curses  Get current cursor position for signal handler in mconf.c 
 * End using dialog functions.
  move cursor back to original position  Print the title of the dialog. Center the title and truncate
 * tile if wider than dialog (- 2 chars).
 *
 * Print a string of text in a window, automatically wrap around to the
 * next line if the string is too long to fit on one line. Newline
 * characters '\n' are propperly processed.  We start on a new line
 * if there is no room for at least 4 nonblanks following a double-space.
  If prompt is short  Wrap to next line if either the word does not fit,
			   or it is the first word of a new sentence, and it is
			   short, and the next word does not fit.  Move to the next line if the word separator was a newline  double space 
 * Print a button
 
 * Draw a rectangular box with line drawing characters
 
 * Draw shadows along the right and bottom edge to give a more 3D look
 * to the boxes
  Whether terminal supports color? 
 *  Return the position of the first alphabetic character in a string.
 
 * ncurses uses ESC to detect escaped char sequences. This resutl in
 * a small timeout before ESC is actually delivered to the application.
 * lxdialog suggest <ESC> <ESC> which is correctly translated to two
 * times esc. But then we need to ignore the second esc to avoid stepping
 * out one menu too much. Filter away all escaped key sequences since
 * keypad(FALSE) turn off ncurses support for escape sequences - and thats
 * needed to make notimeout() do as expected.
