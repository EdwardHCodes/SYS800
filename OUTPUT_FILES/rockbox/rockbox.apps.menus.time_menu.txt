           to return 0! ACTION_STD_MENU will return GO_TO_PREVIOUS from here
           so check do_menu()'s return val and menu_was_pressed  force time to be drawn centered  at least 2 lines for menu  disable the clock_vps drawing  some hardware revisions of the yh820 have a rtc problem: if you try to set
       the time/date it will leave the player in an absolute unresponsive state
       which can only be reverted by removing the battery. Setting time/date
       should be prohibited on this targets. Fortunately we can autodetect these,
       because they always report "02:02:02" as time.
