Handles cursor positioning, line wrapping, etc
All console printing must go through this in order to be logged to disk
If no console is visible, the notify window will pop up.

Handles cursor positioning, line wrapping, etc
================
 FIXME: make a buffer size safe vsprintf? also echo to debugging console also echo to debugging console log all messages to file no graphics mode write it to the scrollable buffer update the screen if the console is displayed protect against infinite loop if something in SCR_UpdateScreen calls Con_Printd
================
Con_DPrintf

A Con_Printf that only shows up if the "developer" cvar is set
================
 don't confuse non-developers with techie stuff...
==================
Con_SafePrintf

Okay to call even when the screen can't be updated
==================

DRAWING

==============================================================================

================
Con_DrawInput

The input line scrolls horizontally if typing goes beyond the right edge
================
 don't draw anything add the cursor frame fill out remainder with spaces	prestep if horizontally scrolling draw it remove cursor
================
Con_DrawNotify

Draws the last few lines of output transparently over the game top
================

================
Con_DrawConsole

Draws the console with the solid background
The typing input line at the bottom should only be drawn if typing is allowed
================
 draw the background draw the text rows of text to draw may start slightly negative draw the input prompt, user text, and cursor if desired
==================
Con_NotifyBox
==================
 during startup for sound / cd warnings wait for a key down and up make the cursor blink put the cursor back to invisible
