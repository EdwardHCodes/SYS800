 host.c -- coordinates spawning and killing of local servers

A server can allways be started, even if the system started out as a client
to a remote system.

A client can NOT be started if the system started as a dedicated server.

Memory is cleared / released when a server or client begins, not when they end.

 true if into command execution without any filtering or bounding last frame run current client set for slow motion set for running times should be 0 for release! 0 - 3 0, 1, or 2 0 or 1

Host_WriteConfiguration

Writes key bindings and archived cvars to config.cfg

SV_ClientPrintf

Sends text across to be displayed

Called when the player is getting totally kicked off the host
if (crash = true), don't bother sending signofs
=====================
 send any final messages (don't check for errors) call the prog function for removing a client this will set the body to a dead frame, among other things break the net connection free the client (the body stays around) send notification to all clients
==================
Host_ShutdownServer

This only happens at the end of a game, not between levels
==================
 stop all client sounds immediately flush any pending messages - like the score!!! make sure all the clients know we're disconnecting clear structures
================
Host_ClearMemory

This clears all the memory used by both the client and server, but does
not reinitialize anything.

===================
Host_FilterTime

Returns false if the time is too short to run a frame
===================
 framerate is too high don't allow really long or short frames
