 *************************************************************************** statistics about unaligned transfers don't reset if block is not running  don't reset if block is not running  don't reset a gated channel  BUG The stmp3700 (and probably stmp3780) have a hardware bug related to
     * resetting the block when channel is running. It appears that at least
     * for the LCDIF channel, resetting the block while the channel is running
     * will make the channel hang. Once the channel hang, it cannot be recovered
     * except by a chip reset. On most devices this situation will never arise
     * but on the Creative ZEN (X-Fi), the OF bootloader leaves the channel
     * running (to display the logo) when booting. It is unclear if this bug only
     * affects the APBH or also the APBX. I believe it is related to the errata about
     * channels not clearing the fifo on abrupt termination which affects both
     * dma engines. Also note that we can't safely reset 'all' the channels by
     * setting the reset mask to 0xffff since non-implemented channels don't clear
     * their reset bit... Also reset won't work on gated channels and won't work if
     * block is in reset or gated, in which case this situation is assumed not
     * to exists  Enable APHB and APBX  Commit and/or discard all DMA descriptors and buffers pointed by them,
 * handle circular lists. At the same time, convert virtual pointers to
 * real ones  We handle circular descriptors by using unused bits:
     * bits 8-11 are not used by the hardware so we first go through the whole
     * list and mark them all a special value at the same time we commit buffers
     * and then we go through the list another time to clear the mark and
     * commit the descriptors  device > host: discard  host > device: commit and discard  Virtual to physical buffer pointer conversion  chain ?  commit descriptor and discard descriptor  chain ? **************************************************************************
