 General mouse handling code for SDL  These are static for our mouse handling code  Public functions  The mouse is at (0,0)  That's it!  We lost the mouse, so post button up messages for all pressed buttons  This clips absolute mouse coordinates when the apparent
	   display surface is smaller than the real display surface.
	  These are global for SDL_eventloop.c  Default buttonstate is the current one  Push the cursor around  Do we need to clip {x,y} ?  Mouse coordinates range from 0 - width-1 and 0 - height-1  If not relative mode, generate relative motion from clamped X/Y.
	   This prevents lots of extraneous large delta relative motion when
