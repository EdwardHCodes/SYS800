  After a brief resbit, Duke decides to get back to work.

  Cmdr:   "Duke, we've got a lot of scared people down there.
  Some reports even claim that people are already
  slowly changing into aliens."
  Duke:   "No problem, my speciality is in croud control."
  Cmdr:   "Croud control, my ass!  Remember that incident
  during the war?  You created nuthin' but death and
  destruction."
  Duke:   "Not destruction, justice."
  Cmdr:   "I'll take no responsibility for your actions.  Your on
  your own!  Behave your self, damnit!  You got that,
  soldger?"
  Duke:   "I've always been on my own...   Face it, it's ass kickin' time,
  SIR!"
  Cmdr:   "Get outta here...!"
  (Duke gives the Cmdr a hard stair, then cocks his weapon and
  walks out of the room)
  Cmdr:   In a wisper: "Good luck, my friend."

  After a brief resbit, Duke decides to get back to work.

  Cmdr:   "Duke, we've got a lot of scared people down there.
  Some reports even claim that people are already
  slowly changing into aliens."
  Duke:   "No problem, my speciality is in croud control."
  Cmdr:   "Croud control, my ass!  Remember that incident
  during the war?  You created nuthin' but death and
  destruction."
  Duke:   "Not destruction, justice."
  Cmdr:   "I'll take no responsibility for your actions.  Your on
  your own!  Behave your self, damnit!  You got that,
  soldger?"
  Duke:   "I've always been on my own...   Face it, it's ass kickin' time,
  SIR!"
  Cmdr:   "Get outta here...!"
  (Duke gives the Cmdr a hard stair, then cocks his weapon and
  walks out of the room)
  Cmdr:   In a wisper: "Good luck, my friend."
