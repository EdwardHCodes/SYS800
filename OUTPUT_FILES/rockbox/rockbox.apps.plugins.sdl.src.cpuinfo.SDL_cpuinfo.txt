 CPU feature detection for SDL  For AltiVec check  This is the brute force way of detecting instruction sets...
   the idea is borrowed from the libmpeg2 library - thanks!
  HAVE_SETJMP  Technically, if this is being compiled under __x86_64__ then it has 
CPUid by definition.  But it's nice to be able to prove it.  :)       TEST_MAIN
