 * DESCRIPTION:
 *      Random number LUT.
 *
 * 1/19/98 killough: Rewrote random number generator for better randomness,
 * while at the same time maintaining demo sync and backward compatibility.
 *
 * 2/16/98 killough: Made each RNG local to each control-equivalent block,
 * to reduce the chances of demo sync problems.
 *
 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------- M_Random Returns a 0-255 number 1/19/98 killough -- made const the random number state killough 3/26/98: The seed killough 2/16/98:  We always update both sets of random number generators, to ensure repeatability if the demo_compatibility flag is changed while the program is running. Changing the demo_compatibility flag does not change the sequences generated, only which one is selected from. All of this RNG stuff is tricky as far as demo sync goes -- it's like playing with explosives :) Lee killough 3/31/98: If demo sync insurance is not requested, use much more unstable method by putting everything except pr_misc into pr_all_in_one killough 3/31/98 killough 3/26/98: add pr_class*2 to addend killough 3/30/98: use gametic-levelstarttic to shuffle RNG
    * killough 3/31/98: but only if demo insurance requested,
    * since it's unnecessary for random shuffling otherwise
    * killough 9/29/98: but use basetic now instead of levelstarttic
    * cph - DEMOSYNC - this change makes MBF demos work,
    *       but does it break Boom ones?
     Initialize all the seeds This initialization method is critical to maintaining demo sync. Each seed is initialized according to its class, so if new classes are added they must be added to end of pr_class_t list. killough add 3/26/98: add rngseed go through each pr_class and set each starting seed differently clear two compatibility indices Emacs style mode select   -*- C++ -*-
