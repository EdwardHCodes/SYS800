 * init_sound

 * Initialize sound variables.

  init_sound 
 * start_sample
 *
 * Call the IO interface to play a sample.
 *
  start_sample 
 * start_next_sample
 *
 * Play a sample that has been delayed until the previous sound effect has

 * immediately follow other samples.

  start_next_sample 
 * end_of_sound
 *
 * Call the Z-code routine which was given as the last parameter of
 * a sound_effect call. This function may be called from a hardware
 * interrupt (which requires extremely careful programming).

  end_of_sound 
 * z_sound_effect, load / play / stop / discard a sound effect.

 *   	zargs[0] = number of bleep (1 or 2) or sample
 *	zargs[1] = operation to perform (samples only)
 *	zargs[2] = repeats and volume (play sample only)
 *	zargs[3] = end-of-sound routine (play sample only, optional)
 *
 * Note: Volumes range from 1 to 8, volume 255 is the default volume.
 *	 Repeats are stored in the high byte, 255 is infinite loop.
