Key_StringToKeynum

Returns a key number to be used to index keybindings[] by looking at
the given string.  Single ascii characters return themselves, while
the K_* names are matched up.

Key_KeynumToString

Returns a string (either a single ascii char, or a K_* name) for the
given keynum.

Called by the system between frames for both key up and key down events
Should NOT be called during an interrupt!
===================
 just catching keys for Con_NotifyBox update auto-repeat status ignore most autorepeats handle escape specialy, so the user can never unbind it key up events only generate commands if the game key binding is a button command (leading + sign).  These will occur even in console mode, to keep the character from continuing an action started before a console switch.  Button commands include the kenum as a parameter, so multiple downs can be matched with ups during demo playback, most keys bring up the main menu if not a consolekey, send to the interpreter no matter what mode is button commands add keynum as a parm other systems only care about key down events
