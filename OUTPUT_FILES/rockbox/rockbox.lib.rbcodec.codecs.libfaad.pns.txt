* static function declarations  fixed point square root approximation  !!!! ONLY WORKS FOR EVEN %REAL_BITS% !!!!  The function gen_rand_vector(addr, size) generates a vector of length
   <size> with signed random values of average energy MEAN_NRG per random
   value. A suitable random number generator can be realized using one
   multiplication/accumulation per random value.
 this can be replaced by a 16 bit random generator!!!!  IMDCT pre-scaling  IMDCT scaling 9710 Do perceptual noise substitution decoding  Simultaneous use of LTP and PNS is not prevented in the
                       syntax. If both LTP, and PNS are enabled on the same
                       scalefactor band, PNS takes precedence, and no prediction
                       is applied to this band.
                     For scalefactor bands coded using PNS the corresponding
                       predictors are switched to "off".
                     Generate random vector  From the spec:
   If the same scalefactor band and group is coded by perceptual noise
   substitution in both channels of a channel pair, the correlation of
   the noise signal can be controlled by means of the ms_used field: While
   the default noise generation process works independently for each channel
   (separate generation of random vectors), the same random vector is used
   for both channels if ms_used[] is set for a particular scalefactor band
   and group. In this case, no M/S stereo coding is carried out (because M/S
   stereo coding and noise substitution coding are mutually exclusive).
   If the same scalefactor band and group is coded by perceptual noise
   substitution in only one channel of a channel pair the setting of ms_used[]
   is not evaluated.
