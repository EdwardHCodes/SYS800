Still To do:
 - Make original speed and further increases in speed depend more on screen size
 - attempt to make the tunnels get narrower as the game goes on
 - make the chopper look better, maybe a picture, and scale according

 - use textures for the color screens for background and terrain,
   eg stars on background
 - allow choice of different levels [later: different screen themes]
 - better high score handling, improved screen etc.
