 *  [ 1998-06-13 ]
 *
 *    *)  A bugfix for the Page-Down problem
 *
 *    *)  Formerly when I used Page Down and Page Up, the cursor would be set
 *        to the first position in the menu box.  Now lxdialog is a bit
 *        smarter and works more like other menu systems (just have a look at
 *        it).
 *
 *    *)  Formerly if I selected something my scrolling would be broken because
 *        lxdialog is re-invoked by the Menuconfig shell script, can't
 *        remember the last scrolling position, and just sets it so that the
 *        cursor is at the bottom of the box.  Now it writes the temporary file
 *        lxdialog.scrltmp which contains this information. The file is
 *        deleted by lxdialog if the user leaves a submenu or enters a new
 *        one, but it would be nice if Menuconfig could make another "rm -f"
 *        just to be sure.  Just try it out - you will recognise a difference!
 *
 *  [ 1998-06-14 ]
 *
 *    *)  Now lxdialog is crash-safe against broken "lxdialog.scrltmp" files
 *        and menus change their size on the fly.
 *
 *    *)  If for some reason the last scrolling position is not saved by
 *        lxdialog, it sets the scrolling so that the selected item is in the
 *        middle of the menu box, not at the bottom.
 *

 * Reset 'scroll' to 0 if the value from lxdialog.scrltmp is bogus.
 * This fixes a bug in Menuconfig where using ' ' to descend into menus
 * would leave mis-synchronized lxdialog.scrltmp files lying around,
 * fscanf would read in 'scroll', and eventually that value would get used.
 
 * Print menu item
  Clear 'residue' of last item 
 * Print the scroll indicators.
 
 * Display the termination buttons.
  scroll up n lines (n may be negative)  Scroll menu up 
 * Display a menu for choosing among a number of options
  center dialog box on screen  create new window for the menu  draw a box around the menu items  Set choice to default item  get the saved scroll info  Print the menu  Remove highligt of current item  Scroll menu down  Scroll menu up  wait for another key press  save scroll info  ESC pressed  SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0+
