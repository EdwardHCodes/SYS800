 * Stand-alone tool to access the Puzzles obfuscation algorithm.
 * 
 * To deobfuscate, use "obfusc -d":
 * 
 *   obfusc -d                 reads binary data from stdin, writes to stdout
 *   obfusc -d <hex string>    works on the given hex string instead of stdin
 *   obfusc -d -h              writes a hex string instead of binary to stdout
 *
 * To obfuscate, "obfusc -e":
 * 
 *   obfusc -e                 reads binary from stdin, writes hex to stdout
 *   obfusc -e <hex string>    works on the given hex string instead of stdin
 *   obfusc -e -b              writes binary instead of text to stdout
 *
 * The default output format is hex for -e and binary for -d
 * because that's the way obfuscation is generally used in
 * Puzzles. Either of -b and -h can always be specified to set it
 * explicitly.
 *
 * Data read from standard input is assumed always to be binary;
 * data provided on the command line is taken to be hex.
