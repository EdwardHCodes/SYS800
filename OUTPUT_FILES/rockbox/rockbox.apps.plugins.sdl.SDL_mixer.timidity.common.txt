  I guess "rb" should be right for any libc  Try to open a file for reading. If the filename ends in one of the 
   defined compressor extensions, pipe the file through the decompressor  First just check that the file exists  Check if it's a compressed file  Yes. Close the file, open a pipe instead.  Quote some special characters in the file name  This is meant to find and open files for reading, possibly piping
   them through a decompressor.  Generate path list  First try the given name  Try along the path then  Nothing could be opened.  This closes files opened with open_file  Any better ideas?  This is meant for skipping a few bytes in a file or fifo.  This'll allocate memory or die.  This adds a directory to the path list  Free memory associated to path list
