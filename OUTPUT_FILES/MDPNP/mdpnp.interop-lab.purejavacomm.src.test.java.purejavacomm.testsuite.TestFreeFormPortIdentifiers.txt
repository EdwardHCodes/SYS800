*
 * This test case tests how CommPortIdentifier handles free form port names.
 * Serial ports are notorious for not being able to enumerate reliably, so an
 * application that allows a user to select a serial port will always have to
 * provide a free-form entry to provide the serial device name.
 * 
 * The API that takes this device name and returns an identifier is
 * {@link CommPortIdentifier#getPortIdentifier(String)}.
