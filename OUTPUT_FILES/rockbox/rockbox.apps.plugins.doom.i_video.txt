 * Revision 1.26  2006-12-13 04:44:17  kkurbjun
 * Dehacked and BEX support for Doom - currently only supports a DEHACKED file in a WAD (not as a standalone file yet).
 *
 * Revision 1.25  2006-10-26 13:38:04  barrywardell
 * Allow the Sansa e200 UI simulator to be built. Thanks to Andre Smith for the nice image of the Sansa. Lots more to be done including testing and tweaking the keymaps and modifying the plugins for the Sansa's 176x220 LCD.
 *
 * Revision 1.24  2006-09-05 00:23:06  barrywardell
 * Fix not being able to exit Doom on the H10.
 *
 * Revision 1.23  2006-08-10 18:34:43  amiconn
 * Correct calculation of necessary buffer size to give maximum number of shades on iPod Mini.
 *
 * Revision 1.22  2006-08-07 02:44:18  amiconn
 * Use striped buffering for grayscale targets to make the buffer fit on iPod g3/g4. Also slightly faster (at least on H1x0) with the buffer in IRAM.
 *
 * Revision 1.21  2006-08-07 01:57:29  amiconn
 * Fix red iPod g3 build.
 *
 * Revision 1.20  2006-08-07 01:46:41  amiconn
 * Grayscale library ported to the grayscale iPods, first version. Added C reference versions of gray_update_rect() for both horizontal and vertical pixel packing. gray_update_rect() and gray_ub_gray_bitmap_part() not yet assembler optimised. Grayscale screendump doesn't work yet. * Fixed button assignments for iPod in grayscale.c
 *
 * Revision 1.19  2006-08-03 20:17:22  bagder
 * Barry Wardell's keymappings for H10
 *
 * Revision 1.18  2006-08-02 00:21:59  amiconn
 * Grayscale library: LCD linearisation and gamma correction.
 *
 * Revision 1.17  2006-04-22 03:48:15  kkurbjun
 * Better video update, add options to startup menu, change default screensize
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2006-04-20 19:39:56  kkurbjun
 * Optimizations for doom: coldfire asm drawspan routine = not much, fixed point multiply changes = not much, H300 asm lcd update = some, IRAM sound updates and simplifications = more
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2006-04-16 23:14:04  kkurbjun
 * Fix run so that it stays enabled across level loads.  Removed some unused code and added some back in for hopeful future use.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2006-04-15 22:08:36  kkurbjun
 * Slight code cleanups, fixed sound parameter - now it saves.  Old configurations will be reset.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2006-04-06 21:31:49  kkurbjun
 * Scaling code fixed by clamping down the width to a max of SCREENWIDTH.  Removed some #ifdefs for glprboom
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2006-04-05 06:37:37  kkurbjun
 * Fix finale text and try and prevent some data corruption due to the scaling code.  Also allows the non-standard GP32 mods to work with some bounds checking.  More comments are in v_video.c
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2006-04-04 19:39:31  amiconn
 * Doom on H1x0: Don't waste memory, the grayscale lib doesn't need that much, but properly tell the lib how much memory it may use.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2006-04-04 12:00:53  dave
 * iPod: Make the hold switch bring up the in-game menu.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2006-04-03 20:03:02  kkurbjun
 * Updates doom menu w/ new graphics, now requires rockdoom.wad: http://alamode.mines.edu/~kkurbjun/rockdoom.wad
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2006-04-03 17:11:42  kkurbjun
 * Finishing touches
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2006-04-03 16:30:12  kkurbjun
 * Fix #if
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2006-04-03 08:51:08  bger
 * Patch #4864 by Jonathan Gordon: text editor plugin, with some changes by me.
 * Also correct a var clash between the rockbox's gui api and doom plugin
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2006-04-02 20:45:24  kkurbjun
 * Properly ifdef H300 video code, fix commented line handling rockbox volume
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2006-04-02 01:52:44  kkurbjun
 * Update adds prboom's high resolution support, also makes the scaling for
 * platforms w/ resolution less then 320x200 much nicer.  IDoom's lookup table
 * code has been removed.  Also fixed a pallete bug.  Some graphic errors are
 * present in menu and status bar.  Also updates some headers and output
 * formatting.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2006-03-28 17:20:49  christian
 * added good (tm) button mappings for x5, and added ifdef for HAS_BUTTON_HOLD
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2006-03-28 15:44:01  dave
 * Patch #2969 - Doom!  Currently only working on the H300.
