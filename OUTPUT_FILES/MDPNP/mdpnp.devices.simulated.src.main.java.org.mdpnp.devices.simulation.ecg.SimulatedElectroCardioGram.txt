  initialDelay period time unit real clock normalized aka 0-15-30-45-0 real clock with possible drift defaults*
         *  @return time stamp for the current data sample. few possible choices depending on the timestamp policy:
         *  if 'drift' - returns real clock with possible random drift.
         *  if 'metronome' - normalized aka 0-15-30-45-0 based on the update period
         *  if 'realtime' - always returns wll time, but if will (optionally if clockDrift is not 0) pause the thread for some random drift value
          too bad, almost harmless.
