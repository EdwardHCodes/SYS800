     * A FlowPane that occupies the top of the BorderPane.  This will be created in the constructor
     * for CompositeDevicePanel, after which its only child will be the device information.  Subclasses
     * can therefore use it to add another child that will appear to the right of the device information.
     
         * In order to keep "header" as it was in this code, but to make use of the space
         * on the right hand side, put "header" in a FlowPane, and then add the FlowPane
         * as the top of the BorderPane.  Then we can add another GridPane or any other
         * component to the FlowPane to use the rest of the space in BorderPane.top
          Destroys unused panels TODO this is getting to be a mess
