 * This driver provides access to a CPLD that interfaces between the SoC SPI bus
 * and other devices. Behind the CPLD there is a NAND flash chip and five LEDs.
 *
 * The CPLD supports SPI two-wire mode, in which two bits are transferred per
 * SPI clock cycle. The second bit is transmitted with the SoC's CS2 pin.
 *
 * The CPLD also acts as a GPIO expander.
