 Considering the range of xcorr16, this should avoid both underflows

         well on DSPs like Blackfin and TI C5x/C6x  Unrolled version of the pitch correlation -- runs faster on x86 and ARM The EDSP version requires that max_pitch is at least 1, and that _x is
      32-bit aligned.
     Since it's hard to put asserts in assembly, put them here. In case max_pitch isn't a multiple of 4, do non-unrolled version.  Downsample by 2 again  Use double the shift for a MAC  Coarse search with 4x decimation  Finer search with 2x decimation  Refine by pseudo-interpolation  Look for any pitch at T/k  Look for another strong correlation at T1b  Bias against very high pitch (very short period) to avoid false-positives
