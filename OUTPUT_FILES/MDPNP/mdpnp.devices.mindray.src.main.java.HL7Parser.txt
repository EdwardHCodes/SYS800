Get Message Header Get all patient results. The patient result contains segments for further parsing. Parse and print Patient Identification Parse and print Patient Visit Information  Get all Observation Requests contained in this patient result Get all Observation Segments contained in each Observation Request.*
   * Parses and prints the contents of an HL7 message with the Message Code ORU
   * and the Trigger Event R01, otherwise known as an ORU^RO1 message.
   * @param hapiMsg

   * @return Returns zero for success
    The message is an ORU^R01. It's an HL7 data type consisting of several components, so we will cast it as such. The ORU_R01 class extends from Message, providing specialized accessors for ORU^R01's segments. HAPI provides several versions of the ORU_R01 class, each in a different package (note the import statement above) corresponding to the HL7 version for the message. Currently don't use values from MSH Get all patient results. The patient result contains segments for further parsing. Parse and print Patient Identification Parse and print Patient Visit Information  Get all Observation Requests contained in this patient result Get all Observation Segments contained in each Observation Request.*
