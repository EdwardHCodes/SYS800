  Enables use of load addr in statichash  This goes along with magic2  The static hash below does the following:
		 * 1st Row: Kernel Offset
		 * 2nd Row: Ramdisk Offset
		 * 3rd Row: FDT Offset
		 * 4th Row: ? Unused/Unknown ?
		 * 5th Row: ? Unused/Unknown ?
		  terminating entry 
 * Message macros
  Get kernel length  If requested, resize buffer to remove padding  Allocate and initialize buffer for final image  Load kernel  Write magic values  Write header and image length  Write checksum and static hash  Save finished image
