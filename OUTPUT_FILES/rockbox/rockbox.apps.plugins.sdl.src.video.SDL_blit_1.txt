 Functions to blit from 8-bit surfaces to other surfaces  Set up some basic variables  This is now endian dependent  ( SDL_BYTEORDER == SDL_BIG_ENDIAN )  Set up some basic variables  Memory align at 4-byte boundary, if necessary  Don't do anything if width is 0  Perform copy alignment  Copy in 4 pixel chunks  Get any leftovers  Copy in 4 pixel chunks  Get any leftovers  USE_DUFFS_LOOP  Set up some basic variables  USE_DUFFS_LOOP  Set up some basic variables  USE_DUFFS_LOOP  Set up some basic variables  Set up some basic variables  Set up some basic variables  Set up some basic variables  copy  colorkey  alpha  Supporting 8bpp->8bpp alpha is doable but requires lots of
	       tables which consume space and takes time to precompute,
	       so is better left to the user  alpha + colorkey
