 This array contains the bytes used to pad the buffer to the next
   64-byte boundary.  (RFC 1321, 3.1: Step 1)   , 0, 0, ...   Take a pointer to a 160 bit block of data (five 32 bit ints) and
   initialize it to the start constants of the SHA1 algorithm.  This
   must be called before using hash in the call to sha1_hash.   Put result from CTX in first 20 bytes following RESBUF.  The result
   must be in little endian byte order.

   IMPORTANT: On some systems it is required that RESBUF is correctly
   aligned for a 32-bit value.   Process the remaining bytes in the internal buffer and the usual
   prolog according to the standard and write the result to RESBUF.

   IMPORTANT: On some systems it is required that RESBUF is correctly
   aligned for a 32-bit value.   Take yet unprocessed bytes into account.   Now count remaining bytes.   Put the 64-bit file length in *bits* at the end of the buffer.   Process last bytes.   Compute SHA1 message digest for bytes read from STREAM.  The
   resulting message digest number will be written into the 16 bytes
   beginning at RESBLOCK.   Initialize the computation context.   Iterate over full file contents.   We read the file in blocks of BLOCKSIZE bytes.  One call of the
	 computation function processes the whole buffer so that with the
	 next round of the loop another block can be read.   Read block.  Take care for partial reads.   Check for the error flag IFF N == 0, so that we don't
		 exit the loop after a partial read due to e.g., EAGAIN
		 or EWOULDBLOCK.   We've read at least one byte, so ignore errors.  But always
	     check for EOF, since feof may be true even though N > 0.
	     Otherwise, we could end up calling fread after EOF.   Process buffer with BLOCKSIZE bytes.  Note that
			BLOCKSIZE % 64 == 0
        Process any remaining bytes.   Construct result in desired memory.   Compute SHA1 message digest for LEN bytes beginning at BUFFER.  The
   result is always in little endian byte order, so that a byte-wise
   output yields to the wanted ASCII representation of the message
   digest.   Initialize the computation context.   Process whole buffer but last len % 64 bytes.   Put result in desired memory area.   When we already have some bits in our internal buffer concatenate
     both inputs first.   The regions in the following copy operation cannot overlap.   Process available complete blocks.   Move remaining bytes in internal buffer.   --- Code below is the primary difference between md5.c and sha1.c ---  SHA1 round constants  Round functions.  Note that F2 is the same as F4.   Process LEN bytes of BUFFER, accumulating context into CTX.
   It is assumed that LEN % 64 == 0.
   Most of this code comes from GnuPG's cipher/sha1.c.   First increment the byte count.  RFC 1321 specifies the possible
     length of the file up to 2^64 bits.  Here we only compute the
     number of bytes.  Do a double word increment.   memxor.c -- perform binary exclusive OR operation of two memory blocks.
