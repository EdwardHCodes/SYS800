 This is the CD-audio control API for Simple DirectMedia Layer  Some CD-ROMs won't go all the way  The system level CD-ROM control functions  Name  Open  GetTOC  Status  Play  Pause  Resume  Stop  Eject  Close  Check to see if the CD-ROM subsystem has been initialized  Check if the CD-ROM subsystem has been initialized  Get the current status of the drive  Get the table of contents, if there's a CD available  If the drive is playing, get current play position  Keep looking  Check if the CD-ROM subsystem has been initialized  Determine the starting and ending tracks  Skip data tracks and verify frame offsets  Determine start frame and play length  I've never seen this necessary, but xmcd does it..
