     * No-Arg constructor that initializes the position
     * of the knob to 0 radians (Up).
     *
     * Constructor that initializes the position
     * of the knob to the specified angle in radians.
     *
     * @param initAngle the initial angle of the knob.

     * Constructor that initializes the position of the
     * knob to the specified position and also allows the
     * colors of the knob and spot to be specified.
     *
     * @param initAngle the initial angle of the knob.
     * @param initColor the color of the knob.
     * @param initSpotColor the color of the spot.

     * Paint the JKnob on the graphics context given.  The knob
     * is a filled circle with a small filled circle offset 
     * within it to show the current angular position of the 
     * knob.
     *
     * @param g The graphics context on which to paint the knob.
      Draw the knob. Find the center of the spot. Draw the spot.*
     * Get the current anglular position of the knob.
     *
     * @return the current anglular position of the knob.
     * 
     * Calculate the x, y coordinates of the center of the spot.
     *
     * @return a Point containing the x,y position of the center
     *         of the spot.
      Calculate the center point of the spot RELATIVE to the center of the of the circle. Adjust the center point of the spot so that it is offset from the center of the circle.  This is necessary becasue 0,0 is not actually the center of the circle, it is  the  upper left corner of the component! Create a new Point to return since we can't   return 2 values!*
     * Determine if the mouse click was on the spot or
     * not.  If it was return true, otherwise return 
     * false.
     *
     * @return true if x,y is on the spot and false if not.
      Compute the x, y position of the mouse RELATIVE to the center of the knob. Compute the new angle of the knob from the new x and y position of the mouse.   Math.atan2(...) computes the angle at which x,y lies from the positive y axis with cw rotations being positive and ccw being negative.*
     * Here main is used simply as a test method.  If this file
     * is executed "java JKnob" then this main() method will be
     * run.  However, if another file uses a JKnob as a component
     * and that file is run then this main is ignored.
      Add a JKnob to the pane.
