  SWCODEC allocates dedicated buffers (except voice and thumbnail are together
  in the talkbuf), MASCODEC reuses audiobuf. **************** Constants **************** must be a power of two **************** Functional Macros **************** MSB **************** Data types **************** one entry of the index table  offset from start of voicefile file  size of the clip  file format of our voice file  version of the voicefile  the rockbox target the file was made for  offset to index table, (=header size)  number of "normal" clips contained in above index  number of "voice only" clips contained in above index  The header is folled by the index tables (n*struct clip_entry),
     * which is followed by the mp3/speex encoded clip data **************** Globals **************** On low memory swcodec targets the entire voice file wouldn't fit in memory
 * together with codecs, so we load clips each time they are accessed.  70+ clips should fit into 100k  1GB should be enough for everybody; will be capped to voicefile size  Multiple thumbnails can be loaded back-to-back in this buffer.  length of data in

     * on 2MB HWCODEC) we effectively own the entire buffer because
     * the voicefile takes up all RAM. This blocks other Rockbox parts
     * from allocating, especially during bootup. Therefore always give
     * up the buffer and reload when clips are played back. On high-mem
     * or when the clip buffer is limited to a few 100K this provision is
     * not necessary.  the clip buffer isn't usable without index table  default  try to open the voice file of the selected language  voice-only entries use the second part of the table.
           The first string comes after VOICEONLY_DELIMITER so we need to
           substract VOICEONLY_DELIMITER + 1  must be newer than we have  table 2 is behind table 1  normal use of the first table  must be newer than we have  must be voice-only if it exceeds table 1  The first string comes after VOICEONLY_DELIMITER so we need to
           add VOICEONLY_DELIMITER + 1  thumb clips are freed first  find the last-used clip but never consider silence  free the last one if no oldest one could be determined  need to clear the LOADED bit too (not for thumb clips)  common code for load_initial_clips() and get_clip()  explicit slot; use that  find an empty slot  no free slot in the cache table?  open error  this must not be called with LOADED_MASK set in clipsize  read error  mark as loaded  clip not included in voicefile  fetch a clip from the voice file  clip not included in voicefile  clip needs loading  free clips from cache until this one succeeds to allocate  handle should now hold a valid alloc. Load from disk
         * and insert into cache  finally insert into metadata table  clip is in memory already; find where it was loaded  reset age  without the extra bit gives true size  nothing to do?  doesn't yield()  just allocate, populate on an as-needed basis later  the first alloc is the clip metadata table  load the voice file into the mp3 buffer  failed to open  load the header first  format check  this function caps the voicefile buffer and allocates it. It can
 * be called after talk_init(), e.g. when the voice was temporarily disabled.
 * The buffer size has to be capped again each time because the available
 * audio buffer changes over time  cap to the max. number of clips or the size of the available audio
     * buffer which we grab. We leave some to the rest of the system.
     * While that reduces our buffer size it improves the chance that
     * other allocs succeed without disabling voice which would require
     * reloading the voice from disk (as we do not shrink our buffer when
     * other code attempts new allocs these would fail)  just allocate, populate on an as-needed basis later
     * re-create the clip buffer to ensure clip_ctx is up-to-date  make sure to have the silence clip, if available return value can
     * be cached globally even for TALK_PROGRESSIVE_LOAD because the
     * VOICE_PAUSE clip is specially handled  Use a static buffer to avoid difficulties with buflib during
 * buffer passing to the voice_thread (swcodec). Clips can be played
   in chunks so the size is not that important  shut up gcc  adjust buffer position to what has been played already  silence clip available?  called in ISR context (on HWCODEC) if mp3 data got consumed  voice_thread.c hints us how many of the buffer we provided it actually

     * this function is called when the talk voice file changes  don't free thumb handle, it doesn't depend on the actual voice file
     * and so we can re-use it if it's already allocated in any event  Now determine the maximum buffer size needed for the voicefile.
         * The below pretends the entire voicefile would be loaded. The buffer
         * size is eventually capped later on in load_voicefile_data()  check for the average clip size to estimate the maximum number of
         * clips the buffer can hold  account for possible thumb clips  create buffer just for thumb clips  additionally to the clip we need a table to record the age of the clips
     * so that, when memory is tight, only the most recently used ones are kept  compensate a bit for buflib alloc overhead.  Initialize the actual voice clip playback engine as well  close again, this was just to detect presence  somebody else claims the mp3 buffer, e.g. for regular play/record  play a voice ID from voicefile  no voicefile loaded, not an error -> pretent success  talking has been disabled  reload needed?  -1 is an indication for silence  check if this is a special ID, with a value  sign-extend the value  speak it  and stop, end of special case  not present  Speaks zero or more IDs (from an array).  Make sure the current utterance is not interrupted by the next one.  play a thumbnail from file  Returns size of spoken thumbnail, so >0 means something is spoken,
   <=0 means something went wrong.  reload needed?  talking has been disabled  shutup now to free the thumbnail buffer  failed to open  free clips from cache until this one succeeds to allocate  ToDo: find audio, skip ID headers and trailers  Don't play missing clips  prefix thumbnail by speaking these ids, but only now
               that we know there's actually a thumbnail to be
               spoken.  finally insert into metadata table. thumb clips go under the
         * VOICEONLY_DELIMITER id so the cache can distinguish them from
         * normal clips  Play a thumbnail file  Does root end with a slash  Spell only the path component after the last slash  strip trailing slash  Play a file's .talk thumbnail, fallback to spelling the filename, or
   go straight to spelling depending on settings.  .talk clips enabled  Either .talk clips are disabled, or as a fallback  Play a directory's .talk thumbnail, fallback to spelling the filename, or
   go straight to spelling depending on settings.  .talk clips enabled  Either .talk clips disabled or as a fallback  Speak thumbnail for each component of a full path, again falling
   back or going straight to spelling depending on settings.  path ought to start with /...  start of current component  end of current component  There are more slashes ahead  temporarily poke a NULL at end of component to truncate string  restore string  setup for next component  no more slashes, final component is a filename  say a numeric value, this word ordering works for english,

   hundred ninety nine".  just say it as a regular number  Say century  as in 1900  as in 1905  sub-century year  Say time duration/interval. Input is time in seconds,
   say hours,minutes,seconds.  strip trailing zeros from the fraction  singular/plural aware saying of a value  lookup table for the voice ID of the units  regular ID, int, signed  here come the "real" units  10^0 - 10^7  talking has been disabled  special pronounciation for year number  special case for time duration  singular?  use the singular for those units which have  special case with a "plus" before  needed for the "-0.5" corner case  say the number  say the unit, if any  Say time duration/interval. Input is time unit specifies base unit,
   say hours,minutes,seconds, milliseconds. or any combination thereof  talking has been disabled  reload needed?  cut off all the pending stuff  spell a string  currently processed char  talking has been disabled  cut off all the pending stuff  if this grows into too many cases, I should use a table  Voice the hour  Voice the minutes  Say o'clock if the minute is 0.  Pronounce the leading 0  Voice the time in 24 hour format  Pronounce the leading 0  default
