 * DESCRIPTION:
 *      Here is a core component: drawing the floors and ceilings,
 *       while maintaining a per column clipping list only.
 *      Moreover, the sky areas have to be determined.
 *
 * MAXVISPLANES is no longer a limit on the number of visplanes,
 * but a limit on the number of hash slots; larger numbers mean
 * better performance usually but after a point they are wasted,
 * and memory and time overheads creep in.

However, the offset is scaled very small, so that it allows a long-period of sky rotation. Vertical offset allows careful sky positioning. We sometimes flip the picture horizontally. Doom always flipped the picture, so we make it optional, to make it easier to use the new feature, while to still allow old sky textures to be used.
