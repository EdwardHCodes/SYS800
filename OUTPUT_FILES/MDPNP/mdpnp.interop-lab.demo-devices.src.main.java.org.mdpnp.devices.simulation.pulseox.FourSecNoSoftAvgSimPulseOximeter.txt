 * This pulse oximeter is "fully fixed" - the averaging time cannot be set either
 * by the operator, or through software.  ICE cannot determine the average time
 * through software - it must be confirmed by the operator

 Need to do something in here about setting an alarm limit...AbstractSimulatedConnectedDevice.setAlarmLimit will be a starting point.Indicate that we cannot supply the averaging time.System.err.println("Doing 0 for canGetAveragingTime");Still need to decide how to indicate an unknown or invalid valuefor cases where it should be gettable.  Return -1 in this case,remembering that when returning 0 for "canGet", this should notbe used anyway.System.err.println("Doing 0 for averagingTime");ICE Software should not use this value as canGetAveragingTimes is 0 Currently the super ctor registers for this callback; so pulseox might not yet be initialized
