This function is only called from the getbit() and getbits() macros when the BitStream has been exhausted and more data is required. Sinve these bistreams no longer access files, this function simple sets an error and resets the buffer. Open the specified BitStream using the specified buffer pointers. It is assumed that enough buffer space has been allocated for all data that will be written, otherwise an error will be generated. This function is only called from the putbit() and putbits() macros when the buffer is full, which is now flagged as an error. This function forces a flushing write of the specified BitStream, and returns the total number of bytes written into the buffer.///////////////////// Endian Correction Routines //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////                           **** WAVPACK ****                            //                  Hybrid Lossless Wavefile Compressor                   //              Copyright (c) 1998 - 2004 Conifer Software.               //                          All Rights Reserved.                          //      Distributed under the BSD Software License (see license.txt)      //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// bits.c This module provides utilities to support the BitStream structure which is used to read and write all WavPack audio data streams.
