 sv_user.c -- server code for moving users world
===============
SV_SetIdealPitch
===============
 looking at a wall, leave ideal the way is was near a dropoff mixed changes
==================
SV_UserFriction

==================
 if the leading edge is over a dropoff, increase friction apply friction	
==============
SV_Accelerate
==============
	accelspeed = sv_accelerate.value * host_frametime;
===================
SV_WaterMove

===================
 user intentions drift towards bottom water friction water acceleration
===================
SV_AirMove

===================
 hack to not let you back into teleporter noclip not on ground, so little effect on velocity
===================
SV_ClientThink

the move fields specify an intended velocity in pix/sec
the angle fields specify an exact angular motion in degrees
===================
 if dead, behave differently angles show 1/3 the pitch angle and all the roll angle walk
===================
SV_ReadClientMove
===================
 read ping time read current angles	 read movement read buttons read light level
===================
SV_ReadClientMessage

Returns false if the client should be killed
===================
 a command caused an error end of message				Sys_Printf ("clc_nop\n");				Sys_Printf ("SV_ReadClientMessage: client disconnected\n");
==================
SV_RunClients
==================
 client misbehaved... clear client movement until a new packet is received always pause in single player if in console or menus
