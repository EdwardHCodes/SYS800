 * is provided by the implementation of EventHandler<ActionEvent>, that is invoked by the
 * KeyFrame for the Timeline.  Then handle() method calculates the current time and subtracts
 * the interval, and those two values then set the upper and lower bounds for the x-axis.  As
 * the KeyFrame has a one second interval, the graph is shifted by 1 second each second.
