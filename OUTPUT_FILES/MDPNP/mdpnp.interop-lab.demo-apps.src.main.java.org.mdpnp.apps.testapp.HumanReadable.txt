 * This class acts as a registry of human readable names, units etc. for metrics.
 * Human readable names for series, units etc. are dotted around in various places.
 * Notably, they appear in the device panels.  Since we want to use them in other places
 * such as the Chart application, we can add them here.
 * This class just deals in simple String objects - classes that want ObservableStringValue
 * etc. should construct their own from the String objects here.
