 This is the joystick API for Simple DirectMedia Layer  This is used for Quake III Arena 
 * Count the number of joysticks attached to the system
 
 * Get the implementation dependent name of a joystick
 
 * Open a joystick for use - the index passed as an argument refers to
 * the N'th joystick on the system.  This index is the value which will
 * identify this joystick in future joystick events.
 *
 * This function returns a joystick identifier, or NULL if an error occurred.
  If the joystick is already open, return it  Create and initialize the joystick  Add joystick to list  Skip to next joystick 
 * Returns 1 if the joystick has been opened, or 0 if it has not.
 
 * Get the device index of an opened joystick.
 
 * Get the number of multi-dimensional axis controls on a joystick
 
 * Get the number of hats on a joystick
 
 * Get the number of trackballs on a joystick
 
 * Get the number of buttons on a joystick
 
 * Get the current state of an axis control on a joystick
 
 * Get the current state of a hat on a joystick
 
 * Get the ball axis change since the last poll
 
 * Get the current state of a button on a joystick
 
 * Close a joystick previously opened with SDL_JoystickOpen()
  First decrement ref count  Lock the event queue - prevent joystick polling  Remove joystick from list  Let the event thread keep running  Free the data associated with this joystick  Stop the event polling  Quit the joystick setup  These are global for SDL_sysjoystick.c and SDL_events.c  Make sure we're not getting garbage events  Update internal joystick state  Post the event, if desired  !SDL_EVENTS_DISABLED  Make sure we're not getting garbage events  Update internal joystick state  Post the event, if desired  !SDL_EVENTS_DISABLED  Make sure we're not getting garbage events  Update internal mouse state  Post the event, if desired  !SDL_EVENTS_DISABLED  Invalid state -- bail  !SDL_EVENTS_DISABLED  Make sure we're not getting garbage events  Update internal joystick state  Post the event, if desired  !SDL_EVENTS_DISABLED  SDL_EVENTS_DISABLED
