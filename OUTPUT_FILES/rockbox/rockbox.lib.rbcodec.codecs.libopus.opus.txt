 First thing: saturate everything to +/- 2 which is the highest level our
      non-linearity can handle. At the point where the signal reaches +/-2,
      the derivative will be zero anyway, so this doesn't introduce any
      discontinuity in the derivative.  Continue applying the non-linearity from the previous frame to avoid
         any discontinuity.  Look for first zero crossing before clipping  Look for first zero crossing after clipping  Look for other peaks until the next zero-crossing.  Detect the special case where we clip before the first zero crossing  Compute a such that maxval + a*maxval^2 = 1  Apply soft clipping  Add a linear ramp from the first sample to the signal peak.
               This avoids a discontinuity at the beginning of the frame.  One frame  Two CBR frames  If last_size doesn't fit in size[0], we'll catch it later  Two VBR frames  Multiple CBR/VBR frames (from 0 to 120 ms) case 3: Number of frames encoded in bits 0 to 5  Padding flag is bit 6  VBR flag is bit 7  VBR case  CBR case  Self-delimited framing has an extra size for the last frame.  For CBR packets, apply the size to all the frames.  Because it's not encoded explicitly, it's possible the size of the
         last packet (or all the packets, for the CBR case) is larger than
         1275. Reject them here. Copyright (c) 2011 Xiph.Org Foundation, Skype Limited
