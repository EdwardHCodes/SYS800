 General fatal signal handling code for SDL  This installs some signal handlers for the more common fatal signals,
   so that if the programmer is lazy, the app doesn't die so horribly if
   the program crashes.
 Set a handler for any fatal signal not already handled  Set SIGALRM to be ignored -- necessary on Solaris  HAVE_SIGACTION  Remove a handler for any fatal signal handled  HAVE_SIGACTION  No signals on this platform, nothing to do..  HAVE_SIGNAL_H
