 Assert reset to cores as per power on defaults Don't touch the DDR interface as things will come to an impromptu stop NB Possibly should be asserting reset for PLLB, but there are timing    concerns here according to the docs Release reset to cores as per power on defaults Disable clocks to cores as per power-on defaults - must leave DDR related clocks enabled otherwise we'll stop rather abruptly. Enable clocks to cores as per power-on defaults Set sys-control pin mux'ing as per power-on defaults No need to save any state, as the ROM loader can determine whether reset is due to power cycling or programatic action, just hit the (self- clearing) CPU reset bit of the block reset register Assert reset to cores as per power on defaults Don't touch the DDR interface as things will come to an impromptu stop NB Possibly should be asserting reset for PLLB, but there are timing    concerns here according to the docs Release reset to cores as per power on defaults Disable clocks to cores as per power-on defaults - must leave DDR related clocks enabled otherwise we'll stop rather abruptly.
