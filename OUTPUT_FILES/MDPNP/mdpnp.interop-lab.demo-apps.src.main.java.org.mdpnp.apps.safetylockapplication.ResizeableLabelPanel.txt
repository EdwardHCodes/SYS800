 * Functionality:
 * ResizeableLabelPanel is a JPanel for containing a modified JLabel called ResizeableLabel
 * ResizeableLabel automatically fills to the size of the ResizeableLabelPanel
 * This functionality holds whether or not ResizeableLabelPanel object is a member of
 * 	the domain of a layout manager that respects preferred and/or minimum size
 * Use:
 * Use the inherited member setOpaque(boolean) to alter transparency (default is true)
 * Use the inherited member setBackground(Color) to alter background color (default is white)
 * Use the member setTextColor(Color) to alter the color of the text of the label (default is black)
 * Use the member setSize to alter the size
 * Do not set a border - this will disrupt the described intended functionality
 * 	Use ResizeableLabelPanelWithBorder if a border is desired
