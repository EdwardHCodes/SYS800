  FIXME no mechanism to warn about duplicate port names*
	 * This has not been tested at all
	  enumerating ports takes time, lets see if we can avoid it check if we can open a port with the given name yep, it exists, now check to see if it's really a serial port Not a serial port, or we can't access it exists but couldn't open. cannot throw anything here, so return a port for it. Might not be a TTY after all, but no way to check that without opening it can't throw it, can't swallow it, try to propagate it FIXME timeout here is not used package  insert the  'addPortName' ports to the dynamic port list and now add the PureSerialPorts
