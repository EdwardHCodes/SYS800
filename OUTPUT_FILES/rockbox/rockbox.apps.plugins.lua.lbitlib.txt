   license, like Lua (see http://www.lua.org/copyright.html; it's
   basically the same as the BSD license). There is no warranty.  FIXME: Assume lua_Integer is ptrdiff_t  FIXME: Assume size_t is an unsigned lua_Integer  Bit type size and limits  This code may give warnings if BITLIB_FLOAT_* are too big to fit in
   long, but that doesn't matter since in that case they won't be
   used.  Define TOBIT to get a bit value  Operations

   The macros MONADIC and VARIADIC only deal with bitwise operations.

   LOGICAL_SHIFT truncates its left-hand operand before shifting so
   that any extra bits at the most-significant end are not shifted
   into the result.

   ARITHMETIC_SHIFT does not truncate its left-hand operand, so that
   the sign bits are not removed and right shift work properly.
