 *************************************************************************** Code to create a single-boot bootloader.
   Based on tools/gigabeats.c by Will Robertson.
 Entry point (and load address) for the main Rockbox bootloader  15 bytes for header, 16 for signature bypass,
     * 12 for record header, size of bootloader, 12 for footer  Copy bootloader image.  Step 2: Create the file header  If the value below is too small, the update will attempt to flash.
     * Be careful when changing this (leaving it as is won't cause issues)  Step 3: Add the signature bypass record  Step 4: Create a record for the actual code  Step 5: Write the footer  load firmware binary to memory.  Scan for attached MTP devices.  if a firmware file is given create a dualboot image.  Create a single-boot bootloader from the embedded bootloader  We are now done with the firmware image  Scan for attached MTP devices. **************************************************************************
