 * This is a dummy JDBC connection object.  As part of the data-logging effort,
 * we introduced a permanent connection method to a SQL database.  The connection
 * definition is designed to be in a file called icejdbc.properties in the home
 * directory of the OS user.  In the event that that file is missing, we use
 * this placebo connection instead.  Yes, I know, it's a dreadful joke.
 * 
 * Almost all the methods in here are stubbed out and will cause unexpected results
 * if used.  However, we know which methods in Connection are used in OpenICE, so we
 * implement those.  Essentially we need prepareStatement(String) and close();
