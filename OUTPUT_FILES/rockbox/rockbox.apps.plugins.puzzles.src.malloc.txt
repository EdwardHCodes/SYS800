 * malloc.c: safe wrappers around malloc, realloc, free, strdup
 
 * smalloc should guarantee to return a useful pointer - Halibut
 * can do nothing except die when it's out of memory anyway.
 
 * sfree should guaranteeably deal gracefully with freeing NULL
 
 * srealloc should guaranteeably be able to realloc NULL
 
 * dupstr is like strdup, but with the never-return-NULL property
 * of smalloc (and also reliably defined in all environments :-)
