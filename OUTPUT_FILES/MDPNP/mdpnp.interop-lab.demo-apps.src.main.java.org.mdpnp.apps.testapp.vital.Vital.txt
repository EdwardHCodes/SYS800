     * Vitals are attached to a VitalModel that has a state. The transition between states
     * is determined by the combination of states of the all vitals that make up that model.
     * If a collection of vitals is modeling a particular scenario, an alarm condition could
     * be triggered when a particular parameter is in the 'normal' range.
