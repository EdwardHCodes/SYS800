 * Description:
 *
 * This library provides runtime configurable encoding/decoding of binary
 * Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes.
 *
 * Call init_bch to get a pointer to a newly allocated bch_control structure for
 * the given m (Galois field order), t (error correction capability) and
 * (optional) primitive polynomial parameters.
 *
 * Call encode_bch to compute and store ecc parity bytes to a given buffer.
 * Call decode_bch to detect and locate errors in received data.
 *
 * On systems supporting hw BCH features, intermediate results may be provided
 * to decode_bch in order to skip certain steps. See decode_bch() documentation
 * for details.
 *
 * Option CONFIG_BCH_CONST_PARAMS can be used to force fixed values of
 * parameters m and t; thus allowing extra compiler optimizations and providing
 * better (up to 2x) encoding performance. Using this option makes sense when
 * (m,t) are fixed and known in advance, e.g. when using BCH error correction
 * on a particular NAND flash device.
 *
 * Algorithmic details:
 *
 * Encoding is performed by processing 32 input bits in parallel, using 4
 * remainder lookup tables.
 *
 * The final stage of decoding involves the following internal steps:
 * a. Syndrome computation
 * b. Error locator polynomial computation using Berlekamp-Massey algorithm
 * c. Error locator root finding (by far the most expensive step)
 *
 * In this implementation, step c is not performed using the usual Chien search.
 * Instead, an alternative approach described in [1] is used. It consists in
 * factoring the error locator polynomial using the Berlekamp Trace algorithm
 * (BTA) down to a certain degree (4), after which ad hoc low-degree polynomial
 * solving techniques [2] are used. The resulting algorithm, called BTZ, yields
 * much better performance than Chien search for usual (m,t) values (typically
 * m >= 13, t < 32, see [1]).

 * @ecc_bytes of @bch, and should be initialized to 0 before the first call.

 * decode_bch - decode received codeword and find bit error locations
 * @bch:      BCH control structure
 * @data:     received data, ignored if @calc_ecc is provided
 * @len:      data length in bytes, must always be provided
 * @recv_ecc: received ecc, if NULL then assume it was XORed in @calc_ecc
 * @calc_ecc: calculated ecc, if NULL then calc_ecc is computed from @data
 * @syn:      hw computed syndrome data (if NULL, syndrome is calculated)
 * @errloc:   output array of error locations
 *
 * Returns:
 *  The number of errors found, or -EBADMSG if decoding failed, or -EINVAL if
 *  invalid parameters were provided
 *
 * Depending on the available hw BCH support and the need to compute @calc_ecc
 * separately (using encode_bch()), this function should be called with one of
 * the following parameter configurations -
 *
 * by providing @data and @recv_ecc only:
 *   decode_bch(@bch, @data, @len, @recv_ecc, NULL, NULL, @errloc)
 *
 * by providing @recv_ecc and @calc_ecc:
 *   decode_bch(@bch, NULL, @len, @recv_ecc, @calc_ecc, NULL, @errloc)
 *
 * by providing ecc = recv_ecc XOR calc_ecc:
 *   decode_bch(@bch, NULL, @len, NULL, ecc, NULL, @errloc)
 *
 * by providing syndrome results @syn:
 *   decode_bch(@bch, NULL, @len, NULL, NULL, @syn, @errloc)
 *
 * Once decode_bch() has successfully returned with a positive value, error
 * locations returned in array @errloc should be interpreted as follows -
 *
 * if (errloc[n] >= 8*len), then n-th error is located in ecc (no need for
 * data correction)
 *
 * if (errloc[n] < 8*len), then n-th error is located in data and can be
 * corrected with statement data[errloc[n]/8] ^= 1 << (errloc[n] % 8);
 *
 * Note that this function does not perform any data correction by itself, it
 * merely indicates error locations.
  sanity check: make sure data length can be handled  if caller does not provide syndromes, compute them  compute received data ecc into an internal buffer  load provided calculated ecc  load received ecc or assume it was XORed in calc_ecc  XOR received and calculated ecc  no error found  post-process raw error locations for easier correction 
 * generate Galois field lookup tables
  primitive polynomial must be of degree m  polynomial is not primitive (a^i=1 with 0<i<2^m-1) 
 * compute generator polynomial remainder tables for fast encoding
  p(X)=i is a small polynomial of weight <= 8  we want to compute (p(X).X^(8*b+deg(g))) mod g(X)  subtract X^d.g(X) from p(X).X^(8*b+deg(g)) 
 * build a base for factoring degree 2 polynomials
  find k s.t. Tr(a^k) = 1 and 0 <= k < m  find xi, i=0..m-1 such that xi^2+xi = a^i+Tr(a^i).a^k  should not happen but check anyway 
 * compute generator polynomial for given (m,t) parameters.
  enumerate all roots of g(X)  build generator polynomial g(X)  multiply g(X) by (X+root)  store left-justified binary representation of g(X) *
 * init_bch - initialize a BCH encoder/decoder
 * @m:          Galois field order, should be in the range 5-15
 * @t:          maximum error correction capability, in bits
 * @prim_poly:  user-provided primitive polynomial (or 0 to use default)
 *
 * Returns:
 *  a newly allocated BCH control structure if successful, NULL otherwise
 *
 * This initialization can take some time, as lookup tables are built for fast
 * encoding/decoding; make sure not to call this function from a time critical
 * path. Usually, init_bch() should be called on module/driver init and
 * free_bch() should be called to release memory on exit.
 *
 * You may provide your own primitive polynomial of degree @m in argument
 * @prim_poly, or let init_bch() use its default polynomial.
 *
 * Once init_bch() has successfully returned a pointer to a newly allocated
 * BCH control structure, ecc length in bytes is given by member @ecc_bytes of
 * the structure.
  default primitive polynomials 
		 * values of m greater than 15 are not currently supported;
		 * supporting m > 15 would require changing table base type
		 * (uint16_t) and a small patch in matrix transposition
		  sanity checks  invalid t value  select a primitive polynomial for generating GF(2^m)  use generator polynomial for computing encoding tables *
 *  free_bch - free the BCH control structure
 *  @bch:    BCH control structure to release

 * Description:
 *
 * This library provides runtime configurable encoding/decoding of binary
 * Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes.
 *
 * Call init_bch to get a pointer to a newly allocated bch_control structure for
 * the given m (Galois field order), t (error correction capability) and
 * (optional) primitive polynomial parameters.
 *
 * Call encode_bch to compute and store ecc parity bytes to a given buffer.
 * Call decode_bch to detect and locate errors in received data.
 *
 * On systems supporting hw BCH features, intermediate results may be provided
 * to decode_bch in order to skip certain steps. See decode_bch() documentation
 * for details.
 *
 * Option CONFIG_BCH_CONST_PARAMS can be used to force fixed values of
 * parameters m and t; thus allowing extra compiler optimizations and providing
 * better (up to 2x) encoding performance. Using this option makes sense when
 * (m,t) are fixed and known in advance, e.g. when using BCH error correction
 * on a particular NAND flash device.
 *
 * Algorithmic details:
 *
 * Encoding is performed by processing 32 input bits in parallel, using 4
 * remainder lookup tables.
 *
 * The final stage of decoding involves the following internal steps:
 * a. Syndrome computation
 * b. Error locator polynomial computation using Berlekamp-Massey algorithm
 * c. Error locator root finding (by far the most expensive step)
 *
 * In this implementation, step c is not performed using the usual Chien search.
 * Instead, an alternative approach described in [1] is used. It consists in
 * factoring the error locator polynomial using the Berlekamp Trace algorithm
 * (BTA) down to a certain degree (4), after which ad hoc low-degree polynomial
 * solving techniques [2] are used. The resulting algorithm, called BTZ, yields
 * much better performance than Chien search for usual (m,t) values (typically
 * m >= 13, t < 32, see [1]).

 * convert ecc bytes to aligned, zero-padded 32-bit ecc words

 * @bch:   BCH control structure
 * @data:  data to encode
 * @len:   data length in bytes
 * @ecc:   ecc parity data, must be initialized by caller
 *
 * The @ecc parity array is used both as input and output parameter, in order to
 * allow incremental computations. It should be of the size indicated by member
 * @ecc_bytes of @bch, and should be initialized to 0 before the first call.
 *
 * The exact number of computed ecc parity bits is given by member @ecc_bits of
 * @bch; it may be less than m*t for large values of t.
  load ecc parity bytes into internal 32-bit buffer  process first unaligned data bytes  process 32-bit aligned data words 
	 * split each 32-bit word into 4 polynomials of weight 8 as follows:

 *
 * Once decode_bch() has successfully returned with a positive value, error
