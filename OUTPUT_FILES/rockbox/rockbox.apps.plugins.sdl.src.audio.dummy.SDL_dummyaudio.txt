 Output audio to nowhere...  The tag name used by DUMMY audio  Audio driver functions  Audio driver bootstrap functions  Initialize all variables that we clean on shutdown  Set the function pointers  This function waits until it is possible to write a full sound buffer  Don't block on first calls to simulate initial fragment filling.  no-op...this is a null driver.  Allocate mixing buffer 
	 * We try to make this request more audio at the correct rate for
	 *  a given audio spec, so timing stays fairly faithful.
	 * Also, we have it not block at all for the first two calls, so
	 *  it seems like we're filling two audio fragments right out of the
	 *  gate, like other SDL drivers tend to do.
	  We're ready to rock and roll. :-)
