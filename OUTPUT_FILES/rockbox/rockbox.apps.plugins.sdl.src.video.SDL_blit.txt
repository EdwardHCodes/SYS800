 SSE instructions aren't in GCC 2.  The general purpose software blit routine  Everything is okay at the beginning...   Lock the destination if it's in hardware  Lock the source if it's in hardware  Set up source and destination buffer pointers, and BLIT!  Set up the blit information  Run the actual software blit  We need to unlock the surfaces if they're locked  Blit is done!  Figure out which of many blit routines to set up on a surface  Clean everything out to start  Figure out if an accelerated hardware blit is possible  We only support accelerated blitting to hardware  We only support accelerated blitting to hardware  if an alpha pixel format is specified, we can accelerate alpha blits  Get the blit function index, based on surface mode  { 0 = nothing, 1 = colorkey, 2 = alpha, 3 = colorkey+alpha }  Check for special "identity" case -- copy blit  Handle overlapping blits on the same surface  Make sure we have a blit function  Choose software blitting function
