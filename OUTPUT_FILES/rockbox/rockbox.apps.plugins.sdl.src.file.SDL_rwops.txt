 This file provides a general interface for SDL to read and write
   data sources.  It can easily be extended to files, memory, etc.
 Functions to read/write Win32 API file pointers  Will not use it on WinCE because stdio is buffered, it means
   faster, and all stdio functions anyway are embedded in coredll.dll -
