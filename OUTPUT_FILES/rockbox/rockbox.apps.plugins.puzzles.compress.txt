 * Output: C source code on stdout defining the following:

 * struct style_text help_text_style[];
 *
 * help_text_words consists of help_text_len bytes containing the
 * words of the help text, delimited with NULs, not a standard C
 * string. The rockbox frontend is responsible for generating an array
 * of pointers into this array to pass to display_text.  break up words on spaces and newline while printing indices of
     * underlined words  title or underlined portion  underline  delete the formatting character  genhelp.sh replaces the underscores in URLs with
             * dollar signs to help us out.  fall through  Groups of words that are centered or underlined are
             * counted as a single "word".  sanity check  remove trailing NULs  This program compresses the help content found in help/ to standard
