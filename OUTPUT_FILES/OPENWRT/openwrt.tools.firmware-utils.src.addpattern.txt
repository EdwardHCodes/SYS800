 * This is a hacked replacement for the 'addpattern' utility used to
 * create wrt54g .bin firmware files.  It isn't pretty, but it does
 * the job for me.
 *
 * Extensions:
 *  -v allows setting the version string on the command line.
 *  -{0|1} sets the (currently ignored) hw_ver flag in the header
 *      to 0 or 1 respectively.
  January 12, 2005
 *
 * Modified by rodent at rodent dot za dot net
 * Support added for the new WRT54G v2.2 and WRT54GS v1.1 "flags"
 * Without the flags set to 0x7, the above units will refuse to flash.
 *
 * Extensions:
 *  -{0|1|2} sets {0|1} sets hw_ver flag to 0/1. {2} sets hw_ver to 1
 *     and adds the new hardware "flags" for the v2.2/v1.1 units
 January 1, 2007
 *
 * Modified by juan.i.gonzalez at subdown dot net
 * Support added for the AG241v2  and similar
 *
 * Extensions:
 *  -r #.# adds revision hardware flags. AG241v2 and similar.
 *
 * AG241V2 firmware sets the hw_ver to 0x44.
 *
 * Example: -r 2.0
 *
 * Convert 2.0 to 20 to be an integer, and add 0x30 to skip special ASCII
 * #define HW_Version ((HW_REV * 10) + 0x30)  -> from cyutils.h
