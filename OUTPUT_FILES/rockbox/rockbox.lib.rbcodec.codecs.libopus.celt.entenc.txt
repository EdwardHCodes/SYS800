  }Outputs a symbol, with a carry bit.
  If there is a potential to propagate a carry over several symbols, they are
   buffered until it can be determined whether or not an actual carry will
   occur.
  If the counter for the buffered symbols overflows, then the stream becomes
   undecodable.
  This gives a theoretical limit of a few billion symbols in a single packet on
   32-bit systems.
  The alternative is to truncate the range in order to force a carry, but
   requires similar carry tracking in the decoder, needlessly slowing it down.No further carry propagation possible, flush buffer.Don't output a byte on the first write.
      This compare should be taken care of by branch-prediction thereafter.If the range is too small, output some bits and rescale it.Move the next-to-high-order symbol into the high-order position.This is the offset from which ec_tell() will subtract partial bits.The probability of having a "one" is 1/(1<<_logp).In order to optimize EC_ILOG(), it is undefined for the value 0.The first byte has been finalized.The first byte is still awaiting carry propagation.The renormalization loop has never been run.The encoder hasn't even encoded _nbits of data yet.We output the minimum number of bits that ensures that the symbols encoded
     thus far will be decoded correctly regardless of the bits that follow.If we have a buffered byte flush it into the output buffer.If we have buffered extra bits, flush them as well.Clear any excess space and add any remaining extra bits to the last byte.If there's no range coder data at all, give up.If we've busted, don't add too many extra bits to the last byte; it
           would corrupt the range coder data, and that's more important. Copyright (c) 2001-2011 Timothy B. Terriberry
