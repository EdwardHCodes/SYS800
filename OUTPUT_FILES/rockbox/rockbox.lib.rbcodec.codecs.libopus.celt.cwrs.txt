Guaranteed to return a conservatively large estimate of the binary logarithm
   with frac bits of fractional precision.
  Tested for all possible 32-bit inputs with frac=4, where the maximum
   overestimation is 0.06254243 bits.This is (val>>l-16), but guaranteed to round up, even if adding a bias
       before the shift would cause overflow (e.g., for 0xFFFFxxxx).
       Doesn't work for val=0, but that case fails the test above.Note that we always need one iteration, since the rounding up above means
       that we might need to adjust the integer part of the logarithm.If val is not exactly 0x8000, then we have to round up the remainder.Exact powers of two require no rounding.Although derived separately, the pulse vector coding scheme is equivalent to
   a Pyramid Vector Quantizer \cite{Fis86}.
  Some additional notes about an early version appear at
   http://people.xiph.org/~tterribe/notes/cwrs.html, but the codebook ordering
   and the definitions of some terms have evolved since that was written.

  The conversion from a pulse vector to an integer index (encoding) and back
   (decoding) is governed by two related functions, V(N,K) and U(N,K).

  V(N,K) = the number of combinations, with replacement, of N items, taken K
   at a time, when a sign bit is added to each item taken at least once (i.e.,
   the number of N-dimensional unit pulse vectors with K pulses).
  One way to compute this is via
    V(N,K) = K>0 ? sum(k=1...K,2**k*choose(N,k)*choose(K-1,k-1)) : 1,
   where choose() is the binomial function.
  A table of values for N<10 and K<10 looks like:
  V[10][10] = {
    {1,  0,   0,    0,    0,     0,     0,      0,      0,       0},
    {1,  2,   2,    2,    2,     2,     2,      2,      2,       2},
    {1,  4,   8,   12,   16,    20,    24,     28,     32,      36},
    {1,  6,  18,   38,   66,   102,   146,    198,    258,     326},
    {1,  8,  32,   88,  192,   360,   608,    952,   1408,    1992},
    {1, 10,  50,  170,  450,  1002,  1970,   3530,   5890,    9290},
    {1, 12,  72,  292,  912,  2364,  5336,  10836,  20256,   35436},
    {1, 14,  98,  462, 1666,  4942, 12642,  28814,  59906,  115598},
    {1, 16, 128,  688, 2816,  9424, 27008,  68464, 157184,  332688},
    {1, 18, 162,  978, 4482, 16722, 53154, 148626, 374274,  864146}
  };

  U(N,K) = the number of such combinations wherein N-1 objects are taken at
   most K-1 at a time.
  This is given by
    U(N,K) = sum(k=0...K-1,V(N-1,k))
           = K>0 ? (V(N-1,K-1) + V(N,K-1))/2 : 0.
  The latter expression also makes clear that U(N,K) is half the number of such
   combinations wherein the first object is taken at least once.
  Although it may not be clear from either of these definitions, U(N,K) is the
   natural function to work with when enumerating the pulse vector codebooks,
   not V(N,K).
  U(N,K) is not well-defined for N=0, but with the extension
    U(0,K) = K>0 ? 0 : 1,
   the function becomes symmetric: U(N,K) = U(K,N), with a similar table:
  U[10][10] = {
    {1, 0,  0,   0,    0,    0,     0,     0,      0,      0},
    {0, 1,  1,   1,    1,    1,     1,     1,      1,      1},
    {0, 1,  3,   5,    7,    9,    11,    13,     15,     17},
    {0, 1,  5,  13,   25,   41,    61,    85,    113,    145},
    {0, 1,  7,  25,   63,  129,   231,   377,    575,    833},
    {0, 1,  9,  41,  129,  321,   681,  1289,   2241,   3649},
    {0, 1, 11,  61,  231,  681,  1683,  3653,   7183,  13073},
    {0, 1, 13,  85,  377, 1289,  3653,  8989,  19825,  40081},
    {0, 1, 15, 113,  575, 2241,  7183, 19825,  48639, 108545},
    {0, 1, 17, 145,  833, 3649, 13073, 40081, 108545, 265729}
  };

  With this extension, V(N,K) may be written in terms of U(N,K):
    V(N,K) = U(N,K) + U(N,K+1)
   for all N>=0, K>=0.
  Thus U(N,K+1) represents the number of combinations where the first element
   is positive or zero, and U(N,K) represents the number of combinations where
   it is negative.
  With a large enough table of U(N,K) values, we could write O(N) encoding
   and O(min(N*log(K),N+K)) decoding routines, but such a table would be
   prohibitively large for small embedded devices (K may be as large as 32767
   for small N, and N may be as large as 200).

  Both functions obey the same recurrence relation:
    V(N,K) = V(N-1,K) + V(N,K-1) + V(N-1,K-1),
    U(N,K) = U(N-1,K) + U(N,K-1) + U(N-1,K-1),
   for all N>0, K>0, with different initial conditions at N=0 or K=0.
  This allows us to construct a row of one of the tables above given the
   previous row or the next row.
  Thus we can derive O(NK) encoding and decoding routines with O(K) memory
   using only addition and subtraction.

  When encoding, we build up from the U(2,K) row and work our way forwards.
  When decoding, we need to start at the U(N,K) row and work our way backwards,
   which requires a means of computing U(N,K).
  U(N,K) may be computed from two previous values with the same N:
    U(N,K) = ((2*N-1)*U(N,K-1) - U(N,K-2))/(K-1) + U(N,K-2)
   for all N>1, and since U(N,K) is symmetric, a similar relation holds for two
   previous values with the same K:
    U(N,K>1) = ((2*K-1)*U(N-1,K) - U(N-2,K))/(N-1) + U(N-2,K)
   for all K>1.
  This allows us to construct an arbitrary row of the U(N,K) table by starting
   with the first two values, which are constants.
  This saves roughly 2/3 the work in our O(NK) decoding routine, but costs O(K)
   multiplications.
  Similar relations can be derived for V(N,K), but are not used here.

  For N>0 and K>0, U(N,K) and V(N,K) take on the form of an (N-1)-degree
   polynomial for fixed N.
  The first few are
    U(1,K) = 1,
    U(2,K) = 2*K-1,
    U(3,K) = (2*K-2)*K+1,
    U(4,K) = (((4*K-6)*K+8)*K-3)/3,
    U(5,K) = ((((2*K-4)*K+10)*K-8)*K+3)/3,
   and
    V(1,K) = 2,
    V(2,K) = 4*K,
    V(3,K) = 4*K*K+2,
    V(4,K) = 8*(K*K+2)*K/3,
    V(5,K) = ((4*K*K+20)*K*K+6)/3,
   for all K>0.
  This allows us to derive O(N) encoding and O(N*log(K)) decoding routines for
   small N (and indeed decoding is also O(N) for N<3).

   and the definitions of some terms have evolved since that was written.

  The conversion from a pulse vector to an integer index (encoding) and back
   (decoding) is governed by two related functions, V(N,K) and U(N,K).

  V(N,K) = the number of combinations, with replacement, of N items, taken K
   at a time, when a sign bit is added to each item taken at least once (i.e.,
   the number of N-dimensional unit pulse vectors with K pulses).
  One way to compute this is via
    V(N,K) = K>0 ? sum(k=1...K,2**k*choose(N,k)*choose(K-1,k-1)) : 1,
   where choose() is the binomial function.
  A table of values for N<10 and K<10 looks like:
  V[10][10] = {
    {1,  0,   0,    0,    0,     0,     0,      0,      0,       0},
    {1,  2,   2,    2,    2,     2,     2,      2,      2,       2},
    {1,  4,   8,   12,   16,    20,    24,     28,     32,      36},
    {1,  6,  18,   38,   66,   102,   146,    198,    258,     326},
    {1,  8,  32,   88,  192,   360,   608,    952,   1408,    1992},
    {1, 10,  50,  170,  450,  1002,  1970,   3530,   5890,    9290},
    {1, 12,  72,  292,  912,  2364,  5336,  10836,  20256,   35436},
    {1, 14,  98,  462, 1666,  4942, 12642,  28814,  59906,  115598},
    {1, 16, 128,  688, 2816,  9424, 27008,  68464, 157184,  332688},
    {1, 18, 162,  978, 4482, 16722, 53154, 148626, 374274,  864146}
  };

  U(N,K) = the number of such combinations wherein N-1 objects are taken at
   most K-1 at a time.
  This is given by
    U(N,K) = sum(k=0...K-1,V(N-1,k))
           = K>0 ? (V(N-1,K-1) + V(N,K-1))/2 : 0.
  The latter expression also makes clear that U(N,K) is half the number of such
   combinations wherein the first object is taken at least once.
  Although it may not be clear from either of these definitions, U(N,K) is the
   natural function to work with when enumerating the pulse vector codebooks,
   not V(N,K).
  U(N,K) is not well-defined for N=0, but with the extension
    U(0,K) = K>0 ? 0 : 1,
   the function becomes symmetric: U(N,K) = U(K,N), with a similar table:
  U[10][10] = {
    {1, 0,  0,   0,    0,    0,     0,     0,      0,      0},
    {0, 1,  1,   1,    1,    1,     1,     1,      1,      1},
    {0, 1,  3,   5,    7,    9,    11,    13,     15,     17},
    {0, 1,  5,  13,   25,   41,    61,    85,    113,    145},
    {0, 1,  7,  25,   63,  129,   231,   377,    575,    833},
    {0, 1,  9,  41,  129,  321,   681,  1289,   2241,   3649},
    {0, 1, 11,  61,  231,  681,  1683,  3653,   7183,  13073},
    {0, 1, 13,  85,  377, 1289,  3653,  8989,  19825,  40081},
    {0, 1, 15, 113,  575, 2241,  7183, 19825,  48639, 108545},
    {0, 1, 17, 145,  833, 3649, 13073, 40081, 108545, 265729}
  };

  With this extension, V(N,K) may be written in terms of U(N,K):
    V(N,K) = U(N,K) + U(N,K+1)
   for all N>=0, K>=0.
  Thus U(N,K+1) represents the number of combinations where the first element
   is positive or zero, and U(N,K) represents the number of combinations where
   it is negative.
  With a large enough table of U(N,K) values, we could write O(N) encoding
   and O(min(N*log(K),N+K)) decoding routines, but such a table would be
   prohibitively large for small embedded devices (K may be as large as 32767
   for small N, and N may be as large as 200).

  Both functions obey the same recurrence relation:
    V(N,K) = V(N-1,K) + V(N,K-1) + V(N-1,K-1),
    U(N,K) = U(N-1,K) + U(N,K-1) + U(N-1,K-1),
   for all N>0, K>0, with different initial conditions at N=0 or K=0.
  This allows us to construct a row of one of the tables above given the
   previous row or the next row.
  Thus we can derive O(NK) encoding and decoding routines with O(K) memory
   using only addition and subtraction.

  When encoding, we build up from the U(2,K) row and work our way forwards.
  When decoding, we need to start at the U(N,K) row and work our way backwards,
   which requires a means of computing U(N,K).
  U(N,K) may be computed from two previous values with the same N:
    U(N,K) = ((2*N-1)*U(N,K-1) - U(N,K-2))/(K-1) + U(N,K-2)
   for all N>1, and since U(N,K) is symmetric, a similar relation holds for two
   previous values with the same K:
    U(N,K>1) = ((2*K-1)*U(N-1,K) - U(N-2,K))/(N-1) + U(N-2,K)
   for all K>1.
  This allows us to construct an arbitrary row of the U(N,K) table by starting
   with the first two values, which are constants.
  This saves roughly 2/3 the work in our O(NK) decoding routine, but costs O(K)
   multiplications.
  Similar relations can be derived for V(N,K), but are not used here.

  For N>0 and K>0, U(N,K) and V(N,K) take on the form of an (N-1)-degree
   polynomial for fixed N.
  The first few are
    U(1,K) = 1,
    U(2,K) = 2*K-1,
    U(3,K) = (2*K-2)*K+1,
    U(4,K) = (((4*K-6)*K+8)*K-3)/3,
    U(5,K) = ((((2*K-4)*K+10)*K-8)*K+3)/3,
   and
    V(1,K) = 2,
    V(2,K) = 4*K,
    V(3,K) = 4*K*K+2,
    V(4,K) = 8*(K*K+2)*K/3,
    V(5,K) = ((4*K*K+20)*K*K+6)/3,
   for all K>0.
  This allows us to derive O(N) encoding and O(N*log(K)) decoding routines for
   small N (and indeed decoding is also O(N) for N<3).

Guaranteed to return a conservatively large estimate of the binary logarithm
   with frac bits of fractional precision.
  Tested for all possible 32-bit inputs with frac=4, where the maximum
   overestimation is 0.06254243 bits.This is (val>>l-16), but guaranteed to round up, even if adding a bias
       before the shift would cause overflow (e.g., for 0xFFFFxxxx).
       Doesn't work for val=0, but that case fails the test above.Note that we always need one iteration, since the rounding up above means
       that we might need to adjust the integer part of the logarithm.If val is not exactly 0x8000, then we have to round up the remainder.Exact powers of two require no rounding.Although derived separately, the pulse vector coding scheme is equivalent to
   a Pyramid Vector Quantizer \cite{Fis86}.
  Some additional notes about an early version appear at
   http://people.xiph.org/~tterribe/notes/cwrs.html, but the codebook ordering
   and the definitions of some terms have evolved since that was written.

  The conversion from a pulse vector to an integer index (encoding) and back
   (decoding) is governed by two related functions, V(N,K) and U(N,K).

  V(N,K) = the number of combinations, with replacement, of N items, taken K
   at a time, when a sign bit is added to each item taken at least once (i.e.,
   the number of N-dimensional unit pulse vectors with K pulses).
  One way to compute this is via
    V(N,K) = K>0 ? sum(k=1...K,2**k*choose(N,k)*choose(K-1,k-1)) : 1,
   where choose() is the binomial function.
  A table of values for N<10 and K<10 looks like:
  V[10][10] = {
    {1,  0,   0,    0,    0,     0,     0,      0,      0,       0},
    {1,  2,   2,    2,    2,     2,     2,      2,      2,       2},
    {1,  4,   8,   12,   16,    20,    24,     28,     32,      36},
    {1,  6,  18,   38,   66,   102,   146,    198,    258,     326},
    {1,  8,  32,   88,  192,   360,   608,    952,   1408,    1992},
    {1, 10,  50,  170,  450,  1002,  1970,   3530,   5890,    9290},
    {1, 12,  72,  292,  912,  2364,  5336,  10836,  20256,   35436},
    {1, 14,  98,  462, 1666,  4942, 12642,  28814,  59906,  115598},
    {1, 16, 128,  688, 2816,  9424, 27008,  68464, 157184,  332688},
    {1, 18, 162,  978, 4482, 16722, 53154, 148626, 374274,  864146}
  };

  U(N,K) = the number of such combinations wherein N-1 objects are taken at
   most K-1 at a time.
  This is given by
    U(N,K) = sum(k=0...K-1,V(N-1,k))
           = K>0 ? (V(N-1,K-1) + V(N,K-1))/2 : 0.
  The latter expression also makes clear that U(N,K) is half the number of such
   combinations wherein the first object is taken at least once.
  Although it may not be clear from either of these definitions, U(N,K) is the
   natural function to work with when enumerating the pulse vector codebooks,
   not V(N,K).
  U(N,K) is not well-defined for N=0, but with the extension
    U(0,K) = K>0 ? 0 : 1,
   the function becomes symmetric: U(N,K) = U(K,N), with a similar table:
  U[10][10] = {
    {1, 0,  0,   0,    0,    0,     0,     0,      0,      0},
    {0, 1,  1,   1,    1,    1,     1,     1,      1,      1},
    {0, 1,  3,   5,    7,    9,    11,    13,     15,     17},
    {0, 1,  5,  13,   25,   41,    61,    85,    113,    145},
    {0, 1,  7,  25,   63,  129,   231,   377,    575,    833},
    {0, 1,  9,  41,  129,  321,   681,  1289,   2241,   3649},
    {0, 1, 11,  61,  231,  681,  1683,  3653,   7183,  13073},
    {0, 1, 13,  85,  377, 1289,  3653,  8989,  19825,  40081},
    {0, 1, 15, 113,  575, 2241,  7183, 19825,  48639, 108545},
    {0, 1, 17, 145,  833, 3649, 13073, 40081, 108545, 265729}
  };

  With this extension, V(N,K) may be written in terms of U(N,K):
    V(N,K) = U(N,K) + U(N,K+1)
   for all N>=0, K>=0.
  Thus U(N,K+1) represents the number of combinations where the first element
   is positive or zero, and U(N,K) represents the number of combinations where
   it is negative.
  With a large enough table of U(N,K) values, we could write O(N) encoding
   and O(min(N*log(K),N+K)) decoding routines, but such a table would be
   prohibitively large for small embedded devices (K may be as large as 32767
   for small N, and N may be as large as 200).

  Both functions obey the same recurrence relation:
    V(N,K) = V(N-1,K) + V(N,K-1) + V(N-1,K-1),
    U(N,K) = U(N-1,K) + U(N,K-1) + U(N-1,K-1),
   for all N>0, K>0, with different initial conditions at N=0 or K=0.
  This allows us to construct a row of one of the tables above given the
   previous row or the next row.
  Thus we can derive O(NK) encoding and decoding routines with O(K) memory
   using only addition and subtraction.

  When encoding, we build up from the U(2,K) row and work our way forwards.
  When decoding, we need to start at the U(N,K) row and work our way backwards,
   which requires a means of computing U(N,K).
  U(N,K) may be computed from two previous values with the same N:
    U(N,K) = ((2*N-1)*U(N,K-1) - U(N,K-2))/(K-1) + U(N,K-2)
   for all N>1, and since U(N,K) is symmetric, a similar relation holds for two
   previous values with the same K:
    U(N,K>1) = ((2*K-1)*U(N-1,K) - U(N-2,K))/(N-1) + U(N-2,K)
   for all K>1.
  This allows us to construct an arbitrary row of the U(N,K) table by starting
   with the first two values, which are constants.
  This saves roughly 2/3 the work in our O(NK) decoding routine, but costs O(K)
   multiplications.
  Similar relations can be derived for V(N,K), but are not used here.

  For N>0 and K>0, U(N,K) and V(N,K) take on the form of an (N-1)-degree
   polynomial for fixed N.
  The first few are
    U(1,K) = 1,
    U(2,K) = 2*K-1,
    U(3,K) = (2*K-2)*K+1,
    U(4,K) = (((4*K-6)*K+8)*K-3)/3,
    U(5,K) = ((((2*K-4)*K+10)*K-8)*K+3)/3,
   and
    V(1,K) = 2,
    V(2,K) = 4*K,
    V(3,K) = 4*K*K+2,
    V(4,K) = 8*(K*K+2)*K/3,
    V(5,K) = ((4*K*K+20)*K*K+6)/3,
   for all K>0.
  This allows us to derive O(N) encoding and O(N*log(K)) decoding routines for
   small N (and indeed decoding is also O(N) for N<3).
