 * Direct addressing: all port and global registers directly

 *   port and global registers accessible via a single command/data
 *   register pair

	 * With this setting, port-based VLANs are still

	 * Set port-based VLAN masks on each port
	 * based only on VLAN definitions known to
	 * the driver (i.e. in state).
