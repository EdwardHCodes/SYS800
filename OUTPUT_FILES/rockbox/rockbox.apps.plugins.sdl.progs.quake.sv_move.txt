 sv_move.c -- monster movement
=============
SV_CheckBottom

Returns false if any part of the bottom of the entity is off an edge that
is not a staircase.

=============
 if all of the points under the corners are solid world, don't bother with the tougher checks the corners must be within 16 of the midpoint we got out easy check it for real... the midpoint must be within 16 of the bottom the corners must be within 16 of the midpoint	
=============
SV_movestep

Called by monster program code.
The move will be adjusted for slopes and stairs, but if the move isn't
possible, no move is done, false is returned, and
pr_global_struct->trace_normal is set to the normal of the blocking wall
=============
 try the move	 flying monsters don't step up try one move with vertical motion, then one without swim monster left water push down from a step height above the wished position if monster had the ground pulled out, go ahead and fall	Con_Printf ("fall down\n");  walked off an edge check point traces down for dangling corners entity had floor mostly pulled out from underneath it and is trying to correct		Con_Printf ("back on ground\n");  the move is ok============================================================================
======================
SV_StepDirection

Turns to the movement direction, and walks the current distance if
facing it.

======================
 not turned far enough, so don't take the step

SV_FixCheckBottom

======================

SV_NewChaseDir

================
 try direct route try other directions there is no direct path to the player, so pick another direction randomly determine direction of search can't move if a bridge was pulled out from underneath a monster, it may not have a valid standing position at all
