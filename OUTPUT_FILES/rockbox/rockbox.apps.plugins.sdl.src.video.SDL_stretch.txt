 This a stretch blit implementation based on ideas given to me by
   Tomasz Cejner - thanks! :)

   April 27, 2000 - Sam Lantinga
 This isn't ready for general consumption yet - it should be folded
   into the general blitting mechanism.
 && !defined(_WIN32_WCE) still needed?  There's a bug with gcc 4.4.1 and -O2 where srcp doesn't get the correct
 * value after the first scanline.  FIXME? #define USE_ASM_STRETCH See if we need to regenerate the copy buffer  Make the code writeable  Make the code executable but not writeable  USE_ASM_STRETCH  The ASM code doesn't handle 24-bpp stretch blits  Perform a stretch blit between two surfaces of the same format.
   NOTE:  This function is not safe to call from multiple threads!
 USE_ASM_STRETCH  Verify the blit rectangles  Lock the destination if it's in hardware  Lock the source if it's in hardware  Set up the data...  Write the opcodes for this stretch  Perform the stretch blit  We need to unlock the surfaces if they're locked
