 ***************************************************************************  Battery voltage calculation and discharge/charge curves for the HiFiMAN HM-60x.

    Battery voltage is calculated under the assumption that the adc full-scale
    readout represents 3.00V and that the battery ADC channel is fed with
    exactly half of the battery voltage (through a resistive divider).
    Charge curve have not been calibrated yet.
