 #include "config.h" here we can use OS-dependent allocation functions  MALLOC_PREFIX  You can redefine av_malloc and av_free in your project to use your
   memory allocator. You do not need to suppress this file because the
   linker will do it automatically.  let's disallow possible ambiguous cases  Why 64?
       Indeed, we should align it:
         on 4 for 386
         on 16 for 486
         on 32 for 586, PPro - K6-III
         on 64 for K7 (maybe for P3 too).
       Because L1 and L2 caches are aligned on those values.
       But I don't want to code such logic here!
      Why 16?
        Because some CPUs need alignment, for example SSE2 on P4, & most RISC CPUs
        it will just trigger an exception and the unaligned load will be done in the
        exception handler or it will just segfault (SSE2 on P4).
        Why not larger? Because I did not see a difference in benchmarks ...
      benchmarks with P3
        memalign(64)+1          3071,3051,3032
        memalign(64)+2          3051,3032,3041
        memalign(64)+4          2911,2896,2915
        memalign(64)+8          2545,2554,2550
        memalign(64)+16         2543,2572,2563
        memalign(64)+32         2546,2545,2571
        memalign(64)+64         2570,2533,2558

        BTW, malloc seems to do 8-byte alignment by default here.
      let's disallow possible ambiguous cases FIXME this isn't aligned correctly, though it probably isn't needed XXX: this test should not be needed on most libcs
