  Open for reading data the current file in the zipfile.
  If there is no error and the file is opened, the return value is UNZ_OK.
 offset of the local extra field  size of the local extra field  windowBits is passed < 0 to tell that there is no zlib header.
         * Note that in this case inflate *requires* an extra "dummy" byte
         * after the compressed stream in order to complete decompression and
         * return Z_STREAM_END.

  Read bytes from the current file.
  buf contain buffer where data must be copied
  len the size of buf.

  return the number of byte copied if somes bytes are copied
  return 0 if the end of file was reached
  return <0 with error code if there is an error
    (UNZ_ERRNO for IO error, or zLib error for uncompress error)

            if ((pfile_in_zip_read_info->rest_read_uncompressed ==
                     pfile_in_zip_read_info->stream.avail_out) &&

                flush = Z_FINISH;
            
  Give the current position in uncompressed data

  return 1 if the end of file was reached, 0 elsewhere

  Read extra field from the current file (opened by unzOpenCurrentFile)
  This is the local-header version of the extra field (sometimes, there is
    more info in the local-header version than in the central-header)

  if buf==NULL, it return the size of the local extra field that can be read

  if buf!=NULL, len is the size of the buffer, the extra header is copied in
    buf.
  the return value is the number of bytes copied in buf, or (if <0)
    the error code

  Close the file in zip opened with unzipOpenCurrentFile
  Return UNZ_CRCERROR if all the file was read but the CRC is not good

  Get the global comment string of the ZipFile, in the szComment buffer.
  uSizeBuf is the size of the szComment buffer.
  return the number of byte copied or an error code <0
