  These are some internally supported special effects that use SDL_mixer's
  effect callback API. They are meant for speed over quality.  :)

 * Stereo reversal effect...this one's pretty straightforward...
  16 bits * 2 channels.  8 bits * 2 channels.  get the last two bytes if len is not divisible by four...  end of effect_stereoreverse.c ...
