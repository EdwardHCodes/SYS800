 Simple error handling in SDL  Routine to get the thread-specific error variable  The  SDL_arraysize(The ),default (non-thread-safe) global error variable  SDL_THREADS_DISABLED  Private functions  FIXME: Add code to lookup key in language string hash-table  Public functions  Copy in the key, mark error as valid  Malformed format string..  If we are in debug mode, print out an error message  This function has a bit more overhead than most error functions
   so that it supports internationalization and thread-safe errors.
 Clear the error string  Get the thread-safe error, and print it out  NULL terminate the string  Available for backwards compatibility  Very common errors go here
